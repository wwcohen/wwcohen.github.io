O proud left foot, that ventures quick within<br>
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.<br>
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:<br>
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.<br>
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,<br>
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.<br>
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke.<br>
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.<br>
The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt<br>
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.<br>
<br>
-- by William Shakespeare<br>
(or possibly Jeff Brechlin, Potomac Falls, 
via my wife, the <a href="http://www.scindexing.com"> world's 
sexiest former librarian</a>).

The inventor of the hokey-pokey died.  That's going to be one long burial ceremony.
