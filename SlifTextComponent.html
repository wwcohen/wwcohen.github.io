<h2>How to use the SLIF Text Components</h2> 

<h3>Invocation and basic options</h3>

<p>
The SLIF text components are distributed as single large JAR file.  To
run it you will need a copy of Java.  A typical invocation would be

<p>
<code>
% java -cp slifTextComponents.jar -Xmx500M SlifTextComponent -labels <i>DIR</i> -saveAs <i>FILE</i> -use <i>COMPONENT1,COMPONENT2,....</i> [<i>OPTIONS</i>]
</code>

<p>
where -Xmx500M allocates additional memory for the Java heap, and the additional arguments are as follows:
<ul>

<li><i>DIR</i> is a directory containing some number of text files to
annotate.  

<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/captions.tgz">sample
directory of files is available</a> as a compressed tarfile.  These
captions were all taken from PubMedCentral papers, e.g., the file
"p9770486-fig_4_2" is from Figure 4 of the paper with the <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed">PubMed</a>
Id of 9770486.

<li><i>FILE</i> is where annotations should be placed.  These are output in 'minorthird format',
which is explained below.

<li><i>COMPONENT1,...</i> are the names of 'text components' to use to
</ul>

The components available are:
  <ul>

  <li><b>CellLine</b>: marks spans that are predicted to be the names
  of cell lines with 'cellLine', using an entity-tagger trained using
  the Genia corpus.

  <li><b>CRFonYapex</b>: marks spans that are predicted to be the
  names of genes or proteins with 'protein', and also
  'proteinFromCRFonYapex', using a gene-taggertrained using the YAPEX
  corpus using the CRF algorithm, as described by <a
  href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/postscript/ismb-2005.pdf">Kou,
  Cohen and Murphy (2005)</a>.

  <li><b>CRFonTexas, CRFonGenia</b>: analogous to CRFonYapex, but
  using gene-taggers trained on different corpora (as outlined in the
  Kou et al paper.)

  <li><b>SemiCRFOnYapex, SemiCRFOnTexas, SemiCRFOnGenia</b>: analogous
  to the CRFon* components, but trained with the SemiCRF algorithm.

  <li><b>DictHMMOnYapex, DictHMMOnTexas, DictHMMOnGenia</b>: analogous
  to the CRFon* components, but trained with the DictHMM algorithm.

  <li><b>Caption</b>: marks spans according to the criteria described
     by <a
     href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/postscript/ismb-2003.pdf">Cohen,
     Murphy and Wang (2002)</a>: <ul>

       <li>Spans marked as 'imagePointer' are predicted to be image
       pointers.  For a definition of image pointers, see Cohen,
       Murphy, and Wang (2002).

       <li>Spans marked as 'bulletStyle' and 'citationStyle' are
       predicted to be bullet-style and citation-style image pointers,
       respectively.   

       <li>Spans marked as 'bulletScope' and 'localScope' are predicted
       to be the <i>scopes</i> of bullet-style and citation-style
       image pointers, respectively.  

       <li>Spans marked as 'globalScope' are text assumed to pertain
       to the entire associated image.

       <li>Spans marked as either 'bulletScope', 'localScope', or
       'globalScope' are marked as 'scope'.  

       <li>Every 'scope' span is associated with a <i>span
       property</i> called its 'semantics'.  The 'semantics' of a span
       is the concatenation of all the image pointers associated with
       that span.

     </ul>

     Additionally, the span labels 'regional' and 'local' are synonyms
     for bullet-style and citation-style, respectively.

     <p>
     Briefly, to find out what parts of an image some span
     <i>S</i> might refer to, you need to (1) find out what 'scope'
     spans <I>S</i> is inside of and (2) find out what the 'semantics'
     of these scope spans are.  For instance, if the span 'RAS4' is
     inside a scope <I>T1</i> with semantics "A" and also inside a
     scope <I>T2</i> with semantics "BD", then 'RAS4' probably is
     associated with the parts of the accompanying image labeled A",
     "B", and "D".

  </ul>

<h3>The Minorthird format for stand-off annotation</h3>

The format for output is the one used by <a
href="http://minorthird.sourceforge.net">Minorthird</a>.  Specifically, the
output (in the default format) is a series of lines in one of these
formats:

<p>
<code>
addToType <i>FILE</i> <i>START</i> <i>LENGTH</i> <i>SPANTYPE</i><br>
setSpanProp <i>FILE</i> <i>START</i> <i>LENGTH</i> semantics <i>LETTERS</i>
</code>

<p>
where 
<ul>

<li><i>FILE</i> is the name of the file containing some span;

<li><i>START</i> and <i>LENGTH</i> are the initial byte position of the span, and its length;

<li><i>SPANTYPE</i> is the type of span (e.g., 'imagePointer',
'cellLine', 'protein', 'scope', etc.

<li><i>LETTERS</i> is (as noted above) the concatenation of all the
       image pointers associated with that span 

</ul>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>

<tr><td><code>-help</code></td>
    <td>Gives brief command line help</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>-gui</code></td>
    <td>Pops up a window that allows you to interactively fill in the other arguments, monitor the execution of the annotation process, etc.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>-showLabels</code></td>
    <td>Pops up a window that displays the set of documents being labeled.
    (This is not recommended for a large document collection, due to 
    memory usage.)
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>-showResult</code></td>
    <td>Pops up a window that displays the result of the annotation.
    (Again, not recommended for a large document collection.)
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td><code>-format strings</code></td> <td>Outputs results as a
    tab-separated table, instead of minorthird format. The first
    column summarizes the type of the span, the file the span was
    taken from, and the start and end byte positions, in a
    colon-separated format. (E.g.,
    "cellLine:p11029059-fig_4_1:1293:1303".)  The remaining column(s)
    are the text that is contained in the span (e.g., "HeLa cells",
    for the span above) almost exactly as it appears in the document; the 
    only change is that newlines are replaced with spaces.
