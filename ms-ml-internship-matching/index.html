          <h1>Master of Science in Machine Learning: Internships</h1>

<p><b>The program:</b> The Master of Science in Machine Learning is
part of CMU's Machine Learning Department, which is made up of a
multi-disciplinary team of faculty and students across several
academic departments. Machine learning is dedicated to furthering the
scientific understanding of automated learning, and to producing the
next generation of tools for data analysis and decision making based
on that understanding.</p>

<p>The MS program in Machine Learning is a small and extremely
selective three-semester program.  Students in the program follow a
rigorous curriculum, similar to curriculum used by the PhD students in
machine learning, and interact closely with the Machine Learning
faculty on research projects. MS students are also encouraged to use
the summer after their second semester for an internship.</p>

<p><b>Students available for internships:</b> No students are still
available for internships (as of April 20th, 2015). 

If you would like to advertise an internship for next summer to our students, please
send a one-paragraph description of your position by email to Diane
Stidle (diane@cs.cmu.edu).
