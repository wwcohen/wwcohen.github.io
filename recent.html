    <h3>Bibliographic Details of Some Publications</h3>

    <p>
      This is mostly of historical interest, since it's generally easy
      to find bibliographic citations of papers nowadays.  Some of the
      papers below are linked to
      the <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/index.html">DBLP</a>
      entry for a publication.  A small number of papers don't have
      entries in DBLP and/or I thought might be hard to look up, so
      here's information on those citations.
