<h2>Using the dictionary</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="stuff/index.html"><img src="stuff/_lib/abooks.gif" align="bottom"><a/>
Clicking on this icon always takes you to the 
<a href="stuff/index.html">main menu</a> for the dictionary.  
</a> 
</li>
<li>
Most words that appear have audio to go along with them. Clicking
on the words will usually read them aloud.
</li>

<strong>Known bugs:</strong> For reasons I don't understand the
dictionary buttons don't work properly the <em>first</em> time you open
a subject dictionary.  The workaround is to immediately go back to the
main menu, then re-enter the subject dictionary; then things will work.
</li>
</ul>
