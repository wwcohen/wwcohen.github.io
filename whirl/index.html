    <h1>The WHIRL System</h1>

    <p>
    WHIRL (Word-based Information Representation Language) is a
    representation system that combines some of the properties of
    relational databases, and some of the properties of statistical
    ranked-retrieval systems.  A detailed description of WHIRL can be
    found in <a href="http://wcohen.com/postscript/tois-whirl.pdf"> a
    technical paper recently published in ACM TOIS</a>.


    <p><a
    href="http://software.cs.rutgers.edu/whirl/whirl_license.html">A
    version of WHIRL suitable for academic and research use</a> can be
    downloaded from Rutgers University.  (Thanks to <a
    href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~hirsh/">Haym Hirsh</a> for making
    this legally possible.)  It is available as C++ source code,
    compiling under GNU's g++, or as executables for Linux or Windows.
