  <h2>Wave-particle duality and the two-slit experiment</h2>

  <p>Let's start with the whole wave-particle duality and the famous
    two slit experiment.  This is actually one of the few parts
    of QM that does have a precise mathematically accessibly
    description, thanks
    to <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Fenymann</a>,
    which I will mostly follow here.  The main difference between
    this description and Fenymann's is use of more modern notation,
    and drawing analogies to ML when I can.
  </p>
      
  <p>
    Wave-particle duality is definitely one of the things in QM that
    inspires difficult-to-understand prose, e.g;

    <blockquote>
      Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that
      fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons,
      exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental
      circumstances. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts
      such as particle or wave to fully describe the behavior of quantum
      objects. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found
      to behave as a wave, then later was discovered to have a
      particle-like behavior, whereas electrons behaved like particles in
      early experiments, then later were discovered to have wave-like
      behavior. The concept of duality arose to name these seeming
      contradictions.

    The two-slit experiment is a simple illustration of wave-particle
    duality.  We will start out by walking though the particle-based
    analysis of the two-slit experiment.
  </p>

  <h2>Light as particles</h2>

  <p>The two-slit experiment is shown on the left in the figure below.
    There is a light source \( s \) pointed at some sort of black
    screen \( a \), which has two narrow slits in it, \( b \) and \( c
    \).  Behind screen \( a \) is another screen \( d \), on which are
    mounted three light detectors \(e, f, g \).
  </p>

  <p>If light acted like a bunch of particles, we could analyze this
    by looking at what any individual light particle (photon) would
    do.  That analysis is on the right side of the figure.  Briefly,
    the photon goes from \( s \) to either the screen \(a \), where it
    will stop, or into one of the slits \( b, c \).  From either slit
    it will travel to either the second screen \( d \), or one of the
    detectors \( e, f, g \).
  </p>


  <p>
    Coming from ML it seems natural to model this probabilistically,
    so there is some probability for each step in the path the photon
    takes.  Jump ahead if you'd like! but if you'd like the long
    story, in ML we'd use the notation \( p( b | s ) \) for the
    probability of the photon traveling from \( s \) to \( b \), and
    so on.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The figure puts in some concrete numbers for these. Let's assume
    there is a 90% chance of hitting the screen \( a \) and 5% chance
    of hitting each slit. and then a 2% chance of getting from any
    slit to any of the three detectors, leaving to 94% chance of
    hitting the second screen \( d \).  (No, I didn't bother to write
    all the numbers but you get the idea, and yes, in a real
    experiment we'd have to work out from observation what the numbers
    would be, and they probably would not be equal.).
  </p>

  <p>Putting it all together it's easy to see what fraction of photons
    would hit each detector.  To go from \( s \) to \(e\), for example,
    the photon has to go through either \( b \) or \(c \).  The chance
    of going from \( s \) to \( e \) via \(b \) is found by just multiplying
    the probabilities along that path:

    $$ p(e | s \mbox{~via \( b \)}) = p( b | s ) p ( e | b)
    $$

    and the overall chance a photo hitting \( e \), via either of the
    possible paths, is found by summing the probabilities of the two paths:

    $$ p(e | s) = p( b | s ) p ( e | b) + p( c | s ) p ( e | c)
    $$

    The equations for the other detectors are similar.  So: if we know
    how many photons are produced by the light source, we can easily
    predict how many will hit the detector.  These probabilities are
    all we need for the model.
  </p>
      
  <p>These probability computations are repetitive, but very easy to
  write down in matrix notation, which is widely used in
  ML.  
  </p>

  <p>In matrix notation, we have this model for the probability of a
    particle leaving the light source and hitting any of the three
    detectors:

    $$ \textbf{v} = \left[ p(a|s), ~ p(b|s), ~ p(c|s) \right], ~~~~
    \textbf{M} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}
    p(d|a) & p(d|b) & p(d|c) \\
    p(e|a) & p(e|b) & p(e|c) \\
    p(f|a) & p(f|b) & p(f|c) \\
    \end{array} \right], ~~~ \textbf{D} =
    \textbf{v} \textbf{M} $$
  <p/>

      through this <a href="01-aside-matrices.html"> introduction to
      matrices</a>.
  </article>

  <p>We could also simplify \( \textbf{M} \) by plugging in the probabilities
    we know will be zero, since photons are assumed to be absorbed by \( a \).

    $$
    \textbf{M} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}
    0 & p(d|b) & p(d|c) \\
    0 & p(e|b) & p(e|c) \\
    0 & p(f|b) & p(f|c) \\
    \end{array} \right]
    $$
