      <h2>An ML Model for Light as Particles</h2>


      <i>
	what's true now though is that there are tens of thousands of people
	that understand AI and modern ML, and this actually has some
	connections to QM - we understand what models do via the math, not
	direct experience; behavior of models can be counterintuitive; and
	importantly it no longer seems odd to study things though the lens
	of a mathematical model instead of via "direct experience".
	
	
	my goal is to explain some of the weirdness, with math that's
	simplifed enough to be manageable, but accurate enough to be
	explanatory.  I'm an AI person so I'm using notation and math from
	ML where I can, so if you are coming from a similar place you are in
	good shape.

      I will start with the whole wave-particle duality and the famous
      double slit experiment.
      
      <blockquote>
	Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that
	fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons,
	exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental
	circumstances. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts
	such as particle or wave to fully describe the behavior of quantum
	objects. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found
	to behave as a wave, then later was discovered to have a
	particle-like behavior, whereas electrons behaved like particles in
	early experiments, then later were discovered to have wave-like
	behavior. The concept of duality arose to name these seeming
	contradictions. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">Wikipedia </a>
      </blockquote>
      
      <i>grab some more quotes about the weirdness and/or summarize it.
      </i>
      
      <i>
	Plan: <ul>
	  <li>light as particles, reviewing the math we need for that (just some linear algebra)
	    in case you don't have it. this is trivial.
	  <li>then discuss the quantum story for light, which is just our
	    linear model with complex numbers thrown in, and an operation
	    at the end which maps those to probabilities.
	    
	    I include a review imaginary numbers, not used a lot in ML, in
	    case you need it, then adapt our model for waves.  basically:
	    imaginary numbers are 2-D vectors, used here to model angles;
	    multiplying them is adding angles, but when they get large
	    enough they wrap around, so $2\pi=0$; and when we add them up
	    they can cancel.

      <p><i>do the math slow first.</i> In matrix notation, we have this model
	for the probability of a particle leaving the light source and
	hitting any of the three detectors:

	$$ \textbf{v} = \left[ p(a|s), ~ p(b|s) \right], ~~~~
	\textbf{M} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}p(c|a) & p(d|a) & p(e|a) \\
	p(c|b) & p(d|b) & p(e|b) \end{array} \right], ~~~ \textbf{D} =
	\textbf{v} \textbf{M} $$ <p/>
