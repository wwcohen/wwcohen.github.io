	  <h2>A gentle introduction to matrices</h2>

	  <p>If you're not familiar with matrices, they are simply a
	  convenient and widely-used way of organizing lots of
	  additionals and multiplications.</p>

	  <p>Here's a more down-to-earth example of when you might use
	    matrices.  Raphael needs get three items, which I'll
	    abbreviate (a, b, c), in different quantities (6, 1, 1).
	    These items are available at two different stores for
	    different prices.  Which store will be cheaper for Raphael
	    to do his shopping?</p>

	  <p>This is an easy question to solve, as shown above: if he
	    does the math, Raphael will discover that he would pay
	    $1.20 less at Food Lion (f) than Giant Eagle (e).  The
	    computation he needs to do is just to multiple the
	    quantity needed for each item on his list by the cost in a
	    store, and then add these numbers up, for each store.</p>

	  <p>A matrix is just a table of numbers.  We can write down
	    all the numbers we need here in two matrices:

	    $$ \textbf{r} = \left[ 6 ~ 1 ~ 1 \right], ~~~ 
	    \textbf{P} = \left[ \begin{array}{rr}1.00 & 0.80 \\ 1.50 & 1.00 \\ 4.00 & 4.50 \end{array} \right]
	    $$
	    If a matrix has just one row, like the one I labeled <b>r</b> above,
	    then it's called "row vector", and if it has just one column,
	    it's called called a "column vector".  I will usually use boldfaced lower-case 
	    letters for matrices that are vectors and boldfaced upper-case letters otherwise.</p>

	  <p>
	    Let's give these numbers names so we can follow the operations we need to do easily.
	    I will use \( r_a \) for the number of apples Raphael needs, use
	    use \( p_{a, e} \) for the price of apples at Giant Eagle'sand so on.
	    So then
	    $$ \textbf{r} = \left[ 6 ~ 1 ~ 1 \right] = \left[ r_a ~ r_b ~ r_c \right]
	    $$
	    and
	    $$
	    \textbf{P} = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 1.00 & 0.80 \\ 1.50 & 1.00 \\ 4.00 & 4.50 \end{array} \right]
	      = \left[ \begin{array}{rr} p_{a,e} & p_{a,f} \\ p_{b,e} & p_{b,f} \\ p_{c,e} & c_{c,f} \end{array} \right]
	    $$
	    And the computation we want to do is to find the total price for Raphael in each store, which if we wrote out
	    as a row vector would be
	    $$ \left[ (r_a  p_{a,e} + r_b  p_{b,e} + r_c  p_{c,e}) ~~~~ 
	              (r_a  p_{a,f} + r_b  p_{b,f} + r_c  p_{c,f}) \right]
	    $$
	    </p>

	    <p><i>general matrix multiplication rule...<i>

	    <p>There are other ways that matrices can be combined.
	      One is just to stick them together side-by-side, or
	      "stack" them: so if Raphael was going to shop with Shaun
	      and Shaun's shopping list was the same except with no
	      apples I might combine those two lists into a
	      matrix <b>Q</b> like this $$ \textbf{Q} = \left[
	      \begin{array}{rrr}6 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array}
	      \right] $$ (Notice I need to add zeros to Shaun's list
	      to make it the same length as Raphael's, so I can
	      combine them.)

	    On the
	    upper right of the figure there's a graph diagram that
	    illustrates exactly what computation he needs to do: he
	    needs to take each
