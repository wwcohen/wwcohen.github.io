  <p>I've always been interested in the mysteries around quantum
  mechanics (henceforth QM), but put off by the general perception
  that QM is somehow intrinsically magically obscure, and requires
  completely radical ways of thinking about things to make progress
  with.  Certainly the math seemed very unfamiliar and hard (even
  though I do a lot of math for my day job!) and most of the prose I
  could find describing QM was more or less incomprehensible. In fact,
  Richard Feynman has a famous quote, "I think I can safely say that
  nobody understands quantum mechanics".
  </p>

  <p>After spending sometime reading up on the area, I believe it's
  really not that bad---it's just that most QM material either tries
  to present all the math and all the specialized notation, or else
  tries to present the main ideas with no math at all.  A better
  Feynman quote <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/"> is
  from his lectures</a>, below:
      
  <blockquote>
    Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very
    difficult to get used to, and it appears peculiar and mysterious to
    everyone—both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the
    experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is
    perfectly reasonable that they should not, ... we have to learn
    about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by
    connection with our direct experience.
  </blockquote>

  Put another way: to explain QM, we can't use physical analogies,
  like we can with Newtonian physics, or electronics.  We need to look
  at the math. I agree!  But I disagree that we need to dive into hard
  math: we can get a reasonable understanding with math that a lot of
  people have.  I'm coming to this area from AI/ML, and a lot of that
  background is quite useful, once you decode the QM notations.
  </p>

  <p><strong>This document is an introduction to QM using the math
      background that students of AI already have.</strong>  In fact,
      all I will use is math that is part of a reasonably good AP high
      school education.  While there will certainly be some math that
      may be unfamiliar to most students of AI/ML, it's generally
      things that were learned in high school or college and
      subsequently forgotten, because these things are not used much
      in modern AI.  When this comes up I will try introduce the
      needed background gently.  I will also replace QM
      notations with more familiar ones as much as I can.
