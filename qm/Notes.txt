 - should probably normalize the probabilities, so add letters for the barrier (c?) or backdrop (g?) 
 - my paths are really not good for matmul, only vector-matrix mul. so in the matrix background:
   - do vector-matrix first
      - with the graph; note operations are the same as above, multiple along paths and then add up 
   - or can do it with the tables of numbers:
      - rule is 
        - match vector row and matrix column 1 "apples to apples, sugar to sugar, ..." and multiply; then add it all up
	- repeat this for all the other matrix columns
   - then extend to neural networks (for row-vector/matrix multiplications) 
     - application place ads - choc chip cookies, apple pie
   - note we don't care what the numbers mean

   - matmul rule extends to multiple rows as well
     - (or even further, give tensor rule!) but we won't need that

 - complex numbers (maybe a single figure as a review)?
   - 2d vectors a + bi = (x=a, y=b)
   - can think of c as a + bi or as an angle and a radius, (theta,r), where a = r cos(theta) and b = r sin(theta)
     - then as angle increases at radius 0 you trace out sin/cos curves
      - a hint as to why complex #s are good for modeling waves
   - compute c1 + c2 just like any vector sum
     - example - note that complex #s can cancel out, unlike probabilities
   - c1 * c2 is just usual multiplicaton and then simplify with rule i**2 = -1
     - but there's a nice intuition behind how it works 
        - consider things with radius 1:  a**2 + b**2 = 1, so just an angle
	  - pick some easy cases like theta=0, pi/4, pi/2, ... and work out the multiplication
	- rule is that for radius 1, we add angles
	- for radius r1 and r2, we multiply radii and add angles
   - z = re**(i theta) because e**(i *theta) = cos theta + i sin theta
     - because power series for cosx, sinx, e**x

   - take home: 
     - think of c as angles / clocks that run counterclockwise starting from 3pm
     - think of c1 * c2 as adding angles

     - so now plugging in complex number to the graph (or matrix) we
       add angles instead of multiplying and add 2-d vectors instead of adding
       and we can get cancellation and model waves, or wave aspect of light
       and interference patterns
