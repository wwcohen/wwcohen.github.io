<h1>The double-slit experiment</h1>

<h2>An ML Model for Light as Particles</h2>

<i>mystery around quantum - hard to understand, hard math - not much
  that doesn't either wave hands wildly and say weird-sounding things
  or dive right into college-level physics, which is not easy.  there
  legend is that anything quantum is just incomprehensible and
  required completely radical ways of thinking about things.  Eg,
  Richard Feynman's famous quote, "I think I can safely say that
  nobody understands quantum mechanics".

  From <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/">Richard
    Feynman's lectures</a> there's a better quote:

<blockquote>
Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very
difficult to get used to, and it appears peculiar and mysterious to
everyone—both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the
experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is
perfectly reasonable that they should not, ... So we have to learn
about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by
connection with our direct experience.
</blockquote>

<i>
what's true now though is that there are tens of thousands of people
that understand AI and modern ML, and this actually has some
connections to QM - we understand what models do via the math, not
direct experience; behavior of models can be counterintuitive; and
importantly it no longer seems odd to study things though the lens
of a mathematical model instead of via "direct experience".


my goal is to explain some of the weirdness, with math that's
simplifed enough to be manageable, but accurate enough to be
explanatory.  I'm an AI person so I'm using notation and math from
ML where I can, so if you are coming from a similar place you are in
good shape.

I will start with the whole wave-particle duality and the famous
double slit experiment.

<blockquote>
  Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that
  fundamental entities of the universe, like photons and electrons,
  exhibit particle or wave properties according to the experimental
  circumstances. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts
  such as particle or wave to fully describe the behavior of quantum
  objects. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, light was found
  to behave as a wave, then later was discovered to have a
  particle-like behavior, whereas electrons behaved like particles in
  early experiments, then later were discovered to have wave-like
  behavior. The concept of duality arose to name these seeming
  contradictions. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">Wikipedia </a>
</blockquote>

<i>grab some more quotes about the weirdness and/or summarize it.

  Plan: <ul>
    <li>light as particles, reviewing the math we need for that (just some linear algebra)
      in case you don't have it. this is trivial.
    <li>then discuss the quantum story for light, which is just our
      linear model with complex numbers thrown in, and an operation
      at the end which maps those to probabilities.

      I include a review imaginary numbers, not used a lot in ML, in
      case you need it, then adapt our model for waves.  basically:
      imaginary numbers are 2-D vectors, used here to model angles;
      multiplying them is adding angles, but when they get large
      enough they wrap around, so $2\pi=0$; and when we add them up
      they can cancel.

The model: $$ \textbf{v} = \left[ p(a|s), ~ p(b|s) \right], ~~~~
\textbf{M} = \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}p(c|a) & p(d|a) & p(e|a) \\
p(c|b) & p(d|b) & p(e|b) \end{array} \right], ~~~ \textbf{D} =
\textbf{v} \textbf{M} $$ <p/>
