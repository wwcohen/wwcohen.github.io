<p>For those many friends whose research I have built on, be warned.
My full name, "William Weston Cohen", is an anagram of the phrase "I
now cite shallow men".  (From <a
href="http://iew3.technion.ac.il/~sarac/">Sara Cohen</a> - no
relation! - comes this warning: "Women's rights activists would
probably request you to use the following anagram instead: 'I shall
now cite women'".)

<p>Through my advisor, Alex Borgida, I can trace
my <a href="lineage.html">"academic lineage"</a> back to luminaries
like Leibniz, Newton and Alfred Whitehead.  <b>Update:</b> My former
student <a href="https://andrewoarnold.com">Andrew Arnold</a> has gone back
even <a href="https://andrewoarnold.com/genealogy.png">further</a>, to
Galileo!

<p>In 2014 I unearthed a strange relic from the past, a sort of
game/website I wrote for my son Charlie back in...I'm gonna say, 1994,
1995, something like that, and I sort of made it work again, although
JavaScript has changed a bit in the last couple of decades. (The main
bugs have to do with sound-file presentation - in 1994 these were
played by mime-file configured helper programs, not natively by the
browser, so now you need to hit 'back' about 1/2 the time after a
sound plays.)  <a href="dict/stuff">Historically interesting? You
decide!</a>
