William Cohen is a Principal Scientist at Google, and is based in
Google's Pittsburgh office. He received his bachelor's degree in
Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> in 1984, and a PhD
in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers
University</a> in 1990.  From 1990 to 2000 Dr. Cohen worked at
AT&T <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a> and
later <a href="http://www.research.att.com">AT&T Labs-Research</a>,
and from April 2000 to May 2002 Dr. Cohen worked
at <a href="http://www.whizbang.com">Whizbang Labs</a>, a company
specializing in extracting information from the web.  From 2002 to
2018, Dr. Cohen worked at Carnegie Mellon University in
the <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu">Machine Learning Department</a>,
with a joint appointment in
the <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu">Language Technology
Institute</a>, as an Associate Research Professor, a Research

<p>

Dr. Cohen's research interests include question answering, machine
learning for NLP tasks, and neuro-symbolic reasoning.  He has a
long-standing interest in statistical relational learning and learning
models, or learning from data, that display non-trivial structure.  He
holds seven patents related to learning, discovery, information
retrieval, and data integration, and is the author of more than 200
publications.

<p>Dr. Cohen is also a Consulting Professor at the School of Computer
Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

recommendation</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/postscript/sdm-2007-leak.pdf">leak

additional pane that pops up after you send a message, giving you one
final chance to fix any errors in your recipient list.  There's a
brief <a href="cutonce.pdf">writeup on how to use it,</a> but it's
pretty self-explanatory: just download it, open Thunderbird, and go to
the tools->addon menu to install.  After you've installed it, you
train by opening your folder of "Sent" mail and pressing the "train"
button.  (This took about an hour for my 9000+ old messages.)

at <a href="http://dbirday2006.rutgers.edu/">DB/IR Day 2006.</a> (Powerpoint; 6Mb)</li>

<li><a href="webdb-talk.ppt">A Century Of Progress On Information

<p>
<li>Tutorials:
<ul>

  <li><a href="ie-survey.ppt">Information extraction</a> (PowerPoint;
  4.8Mb), aimed at folks somewhat familiar with statistical NLP
  methods.  And thanks to Thierry Poibeau, there's also a version <a
  href="http://www-lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~poibeau/cours/fr_cohen_ie_tutorial.ppt"><i>en francais</i></a> (did I get that right, Thierry?) 
  Also, two earlier versions of this are also still around, both
  given with Andew McCallum at recent conferences, <a
  href="kdd2003-tutorial.ppt">KDD-2003</a>(PowerPoint; 6.8Mb) and <a
  href="nips-ie-tutorial.ppt">NIPS-2002</a>.

  <li><a href="text-cat-tutorial.ppt">Text classification</a>
  (PowerPoint; 3Mb), given at a CALD Summer Course.

  <li><a href="collab-filtering-tutorial.ppt">Collaborative
  filtering</a> (PowerPoint; 9.1Mb), given at a DIMACS workshop.

</ul> 


<p>
<li>A mini-course on record linkage and matching:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="Matching-1.ppt">Overview of record linkage methods</a>(PowerPoint; 250kb).
  <li><a href="Matching-2.ppt">Overview of distance metrics for strings</a>(PowerPoint; 530kb).
  <li><a href="Matching-3.ppt">Overview of using HMMs for normalizing
text in record linkage tasks</a>(PowerPoint; 640kb). <br>
  It's not a presentation, but I have also put together a <a
  href="matching/">short annotated bibliography of record linkage and
  matching papers</a>.

  <li>William Hayes has a nice summary of <a href="http://blog.williamhayes.org/2012/07/string-similarity.html">an extended discussion
      of string-matching tools</a> on the BioNLP mailing list (July 2012).
  </ul>

  

<p>
<li>Other technical talks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="ijcai-2005.ppt">A presentation of my IJCAI-2005 results</a>
on "stacked sequential learning", presented in Edinburgh in August, 2005.
  <li><a href="nips-2002.ppt">A presentation of my NIPS-2002 results</a>
on using bootstrapping techniques to improve web page classification,
given at CMU in October 2002. (PowerPoint; 3.2mb).

<p>For those many friends whose research I have built on, be warned.
My full name, "William Weston Cohen", is an anagram of the phrase "I
now cite shallow men".  (From <a
href="http://iew3.technion.ac.il/~sarac/">Sara Cohen</a> - no
relation! - comes this warning: "Women's rights activists would
probably request you to use the following anagram instead: 'I shall
now cite women'".)

<p>Through my advisor, Alex Borgida, I can trace my <a
href="lineage.html">"academic lineage"</a> back to luminaries like
Leibniz, Newton and Alfred Whitehead.

<p>In 2014 I unearthed a strange relic from the past, a sort of
game/website I wrote for my son Charlie back in...I'm gonna say, 1994,
1995, something like that, and I sort of made it work again, although
JavaScript has changed a bit in the last couple of decades. (The main
bugs have to do with sound-file presentation - in 1994 these were
played by mime-file configured helper programs, not natively by the
browser, so now you need to hit 'back' about 1/2 the time after a
sound plays.)  <a href="dict/stuff">Historically interesting? You
decide!</a>
