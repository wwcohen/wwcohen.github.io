<h3>SCHEDULING RULES:</h3>
<b>At most one</b> DAP oral per week.&nbsp; If one is already
scheduled for a Wednesday, do not schedule one for the preceding
Monday, and vice versa.

<p>
Each class is long enough to hold:
<ul>
<li>One DAP oral, <b>or</b>
<li>Two 30-minute talks (including speaking skills talks), <b>or</b>

<li>One 30-minute (or speaking skills) and three 5-minute talks, <b>or</b>
<li>Five 5-minute talks

The ML Journal Club meets twice a week, on <b>Mondays and Wednesdays,
  3-4:20PM in GHC 4301</b>.&nbsp; It is
  designed to give students experience in making presentations.&nbsp; 
 In addition, students can use the Journal Club to satisfy two MLD
  requirements: the speaking skills requirement and the Data Analysis
  Project oral requirement.&nbsp; The course is worth 6 credits (half
  the size of a typical MLD course).&nbsp;  Attendance is required for
  credit; contact the instructors if you need to miss a class for any
  reason.

All MLD PhD students are required to take the journal club twice:
  typically once in their first year and once in their second or third
  year.&nbsp; Secondary MS students should register in the semester
  when they give their DAP oral presentation.

<b>REQUIREMENTS:</b>
</td>

Your talk schedule will typically differ depending on whether this is
  the first or second time you are taking the Journal Club, and
  whether you are a PhD or MS student.&nbsp; See also TALK
  TYPES below.
<ul>
<li>
First-time PhD students: must sign up for a 5-min talk and a 30-min
  talk.&nbsp; May
  sign up for a speaking skills talk as well.&nbsp; The speaking
  skills talk should be scheduled after the 30-minute talk.

</li>
<li>
Repeat PhD students: must sign up for a 5-minute, and at least one of speaking skills (if not already completed), 30 minute, or DAP oral.</li>
<li>
MS students: sign up for a DAP oral.&nbsp; Space permitting, may also
sign up for 5-min and 30-min talks.

<b>NOTICE:</b>
</td>
<td>
  Please sign up for talk slots early since slots fill up very
  fast.&nbsp; If the slots are filled and you cannot meet all the
  requirements of the course for that semester, please drop the class
  and try again next semester.
  <p>

  If for some reason you have to cancel a scheduled talk, please make
  sure that everyone involved knows as early as possible: Diane, the
  instructors, and the speaking club if relevant.  We expect, however,
  that students will make every reasonable effort not to cancel talks
  once scheduled, since talk slots are a scarce resource and should
  not be wasted.

<b>HOW TO SCHEDULE:</b>
</td>
<td>
  To schedule a talk, use the links near the top of this page.&nbsp;
  First consult the Master List, which is
  read-only and describes which dates can have talks scheduled.&nbsp;

  Then consult the Schedule and select an open date which respects the
  scheduling rules.&nbsp; 
  Next send an email message to the JC Group to reserve your
  slot.&nbsp; (In case of conflicting messages in the JC Group,
  whichever message was timestamped first gets precedence.)&nbsp;
  Finally, edit the Schedule to insert your name and talk title on the
  chosen day.<p>

  In the case of a DAP oral, please also: get approval of the date
  from your advisor (advisors are required to attend DAP orals); make
  sure to provide a draft DAP document to the instructors for approval
  a month ahead of time; and send an abstract to Diane at least a week
  ahead of time.&nbsp; In the case of a speaking skills talk, please
  also: make sure that at least two faculty can attend and fill out
  your evaluation form.&nbsp;
  (Typically one of these is a Journal Club instructor and the other
  is your advisor, but we can accommodate other arrangements.&nbsp; If
  there are two instructors for Journal Club in some semester, <b>do
  not</b> assume that both will be present on any given day.)<p>

  If you need to swap talk slots with someone, that is fine (as long
  as everyone involved agrees and the new schedule is consistent with
  the Master List and the scheduling rules).&nbsp; Just send a single
  message to the JC Group describing the swap, and then edit
  the Schedule.&nbsp; For DB purists, swaps are considered atomic
  operations: it can't happen that you lose a slot by swapping with
  someone.<p>
  
  In case of conflict between the various sources: the Master List and
  scheduling rules take first priority.&nbsp; Then comes the JC Group,
  and finally the Schedule.&nbsp; Each person is responsible for
  keeping their own talks updated on the Schedule and for making sure
  that any conflicts involving their talks are resolved.&nbsp; If you
  notice a conflict, please let everyone involved know about it, and
  fix it if you can.<p>

  
  We apologize for the complexity of the scheduling scheme: in past
  semesters, 
  simpler schemes have resulted in a lot of work for everyone to try
  to clean up a broken schedule.&nbsp; Hopefully we've gotten it right
  this semester, and the scheduling will be both transparent and fair.

<b>TALK TYPES: </b>
</td>
<td>
<b>5-min talk</b><br>
This is the &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; talk, in which you attempt to convince the audience quickly of the importance 
of some research idea. (It does not have to be your own idea.) This talk should use only a very small number 
of slides; one of the most common mistakes is to try to include too much information. In addition, the talk 
should have a clear goal in mind; at the end of the talk, the audience should know what this goal is and 
whether they agree with it. <br><br>

<b>30-min talk</b><br>
This is intended to be practice for a typical conference presentation, although it is longer than many. The 
talk should cover an idea in some technical detail, and be accessible to a general ML audience. It should 
clearly present the idea in the context of related work. Again, the idea may be yours or may be one that you 
have read about; in the latter case, it can be better to synthesize a few related papers, rather than depending 
on just one, since single papers often do not give adequate perspective on an idea. <br><br>
<b>Speaking Skills</b><br>
The talk is presented in the Machine Learning Journal Club, and members of the speaking committee attend 
and evaluate the presentation, as well as provide oral and written feedback to the student. (See the <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/current_students/Speaking%20Skills%20Form.pdf">form</a> for an idea of what the evaluation is based on.) The student's advisor 
is encouraged to attend the talk. 
It is your responsibility to make sure that Diane knows the date of your talk as early as possible, and has a title and abstract at least a week ahead of time for advertising the talk. Also, add your talk title and abstract to the google doc. 
Immediately after the talk, the speaking committee members confer among 
themselves (with the student absent) about the presentation. To pass, at least one faculty member of the Speaking Skills Committee, and at least two student members, must be present.  All faculty members in attendance, and at least one of the student members, must give an evaluation of "good" or better. <br><br>
<b>DAP (Data Analysis Project)</b><br>
The requirements of the Data Analysis Project are:
<ul>
<li>
A presentation of the work during the Machine Learning Journal Club course. The presentation stands in lieu 
of a defense of the Data Analysis Project, and helps to disseminate the work to the rest of the Machine 
Learning community. There will be a limited set of dates available for such presentations&mdash;generally, at 
most one per week&mdash;so students should be sure to sign up early in the Machine Learning Journal Club. The student's 
advisor has to be present during the presentation, so please check with them before scheduling the DAP oral. 
It is your responsibility to make sure that Diane knows the date of
  your talk as early as possible, and has a title and abstract at
  least a week ahead of time for advertising the talk. Also, please add your talk title and abstract to the Schedule. The 
presentation should be suitable for a general machine learning audience, i.e., it should provide sufficient 
background for a non-domain-expert to understand the results, and should adequately summarize the relationship 
of the project to previous work.

<br><br></li>
<li>
A stand-alone, single author or lead author written paper that is approved by the faculty member(s) advising the Project. 
The paper should be of high quality, both in terms of exposition of technical details and overall English and organization. 
It should be suitable for submission to a journal or refereed conference. But, unlike some conference papers, 
it should be completely self-contained, including all descriptions necessary for a general machine learning audience 
to follow the theoretical development and reproduce the experimental results. This requirement may (but does not have to) 
result in the project paper being substantially longer than a conference proceedings paper on which it is based. Although 
it does not have to be published, publishing the paper may be desirable and helpful to the student. Project papers will 
become part of the MLD archives, and will serve as examples to future students.
<br><br></li>
<li>
The student must provide a draft of the paper at least one month before the oral presentation to the instructor(s) of 
the ML Journal Club. Both student and advisor(s) must certify that this draft is substantially complete. Within two 
weeks of submission, the instructor(s) will either approve the project for presentation (at which point the presentation 
can be advertised to the members of the department), or notify the student that changes will be required before presentation. 
This approval is for the general topic and content, and not for the final contents of the document. The final version of the 
paper, incorporating any feedback received at the oral presentation, should be submitted for review no later than one month 
after the oral presentation. 
<br><br></li>
</ul>
Some common questions about DAP orals:
<ul>
<li>
How long is the talk supposed to be?<br>
Usually the talk itself is ~45 min; together with time for questions, it will take an hour or so.
</li>
<li>
What is the appropriate level of technical detail?<br>

The DAP talk can and should have technical detail. Remember, though, that your audience is mostly early-year ML students; 
so, you'll still need to make the talk self-contained. You can have a few slides accessible only to experts, but you should 
make sure that you don't lose the rest of the audience during these slides.
<li>
What are the evaluation criteria?<br>
At a basic level, there needs to be data, and an analysis of this data. The analysis methodology must be technically correct 
and nontrivial, demonstrating skill of the level expected from students who've taken our core courses. The talk should be 
well organized, well delivered, and understandable. While it is not a requirement, the DAP may include novel research, and 
if so, the talk should convince the audience that the research is clever and relevant. 
</li>
</ul>
<b>Other:</b><br> 
We're open to suggestions, for anyone who wants to practice a particular type of speaking. The &ldquo;other&rdquo; talk type would 
typically replace a 30-minute talk; for example, we've had students
  practice whiteboard-style lecturing, or talking without slides, or
