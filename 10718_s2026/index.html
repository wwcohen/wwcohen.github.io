<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is a project- and discuss-based course designed to provide
  students training and experience in solving real-world problems
  using machine learning, exploring the interface between research and
  practice. The goal of this course is to give students exposure to
  the nuance of applying machine learning to the real-world, where
  common assumptions (like iid and stationarity) break down. Students
  will learn how to formulate real-world business or policy scenarios
  as machine learning problems, how to address common challenges which
  arise in applying ML to such problems (e.g., distribution shift or
  missingness), how to rigorously evaluate the results of such
  interventions in practice; and how to present such empirical results
  orally and in writing.  We will place an emphasis throughout on
  issues related to ethics and fairness in machine learning, and
  discuss how choices throughout the machine learning pipeline –
  including problem formulation, outcome definition, data collection,
  and model training – contribute to the social impact of algorithmic
  systems.
</p>

<p>After completing the course, students should be able to
design and evaluate novel combinations of learning algorithms;
take real-world questions involving data and evaluate and/or develop appropriate methods to answer these questions;
and present technical material clearly, in spoken and written form.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Students entering the class are expected to have a pre-existing
  working knowledge of common machine learning methods, as well as
  implementation in Python. We will focus on how to choose between
  different machine learning techniques, modify them to address common
  real-world challenges, and evaluate their performance. We will assume
  that students are already familiar with the models themselves (e.g.,
  linear regression, decisions trees, ensembles, neural networks), as
  well as how to train such models in Python.</p>

<p>The core content of this course does not exactly follow any one
textbook. We will have required and suggested readings associated with
each lecture, which can be found on the course website. Two general
references that may be helpful are:

  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Course Components</h2>

<p>The requirements of this course consist of two components:
  participating in in-class discussions, presentating material for
  class, and completing the course project.</p>

<h3>Class discussions</h3>

<p>
  This course emphasizes the process of thinking
  through real-world problems and how and when they can be addressed
  using machine learning. Accordingly, our class sessions will rely on
  student participation to discuss potential scenarios and case studies
  together. You are highly encouraged to engage actively during class
  discussions, which will make the course much more exciting for
  everyone. During such discussions, we expect you to be respectful at
  all times towards your fellow students.
  
  Discussions will loosely follow
  the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html">role-playing
  seminar</a> format; for each paper, you will either be assigned a
  presenter role or complete the non-presenter assignment (described
  below).
</p>

<h4>Presenter assignment</h4> 
<p>You will periodically present a paper in class, taking on one of the following presenter roles.
<ul>
<li> Educator: Explain the key ideas in the paper to the class. Keep your presentation to 5-10 minutes maximum.
<li> Investigator: Investigate one of the paper’s authors. What is their area of expertise? Where have they worked previously? What prior projects might have led to working on this one? Explore what motivated them to write the paper and what biases they may have.
<li> Reviewer: Discuss both one strength and one weakness of the paper. What did you like about the paper? Do you agree with the paper's stance/findings? Did the paper overlook anything? Is there something that could have strengthened the work?
<li> Discussion Leader: Prepare three discussion questions to ask the class, and lead the discussion amongst the students when answering these questions.
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Non-presenter assignment</h4>

<p>If you are not presenting the paper, you must still read the paper
  and provide at least one discussion question about the paper (e.g.,
  something you're uncertain about or would like to hear discussed).
</p>

<h3>Course project</h3>

<p>
Students will complete a semester-long course project that explores
the application of machine learning to a problem of practical
interest. Students may work in groups of two or three people. Each
group will select a dataset, which _cannot_ be one commonly used in
machine learning research. Over a series of assignments, each group
will define a problem to be addressed using the dataset, clean and
explore the data, develop baselines and machine learning models, and explore
the impact of additional desiderata on their pipeline (e.g., fairness,
privacy, interpretability, or model efficiency). Students can either
select their own dataset for the project (which cannot be a commonly
used ML benchmark dataset) or select one from the set of examples
provided.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

Each component will contribute towards the final grade as follows:

<h4>Discussion participation</h4>
Discussion and participation is 35%, graded out of 30 points.

<ul>
<li> Presenter assignments: 3 over the course of the semester, 5 points each. 15 total points
<li> Non-presenter assignments: 15 over the course of the semester, 1 point each
<li> You are allowed to miss one non-presenter assignment without penalty.
<li> This format may be adjusted as needed during the semester.
</ul>

<h4>Course project</h4>
The project is 60%, graded out of 100 points

<ul>
<li> Assignment 0 (dataset): 5 points
<li> Assignment 1 (proposal and data exploration): 15 points
<li> Assignment 2 (baselines): 15 points
<li> Assignment 3 (additional metrics): 15 points
<li> Assignment 4 (final report): 15 points
</ul>


<h2>Other policies</h2>

<h4>Regrade requests</h4> If you believe an error was made during grading,
please open a regrade request in Gradescope. For each assignment,
regrade requests will be open for only 2 weeks after the grades have
been published. This is to encourage you to check the feedback you’ve
received early!
</p>

<h4>Late homeworks</h4>You have 4 total grace days that can be used to submit late homework assignments without penalty. We will automatically keep a tally of these grace days for you; they will be applied greedily. You may not use more than 2 grace days on any single homework assignment. Additionally, please note:

<ul>
<li>All homework submissions are electronic, and lateness will be determined by the latest timestamp of any part of your submission. 
<li>Once you have exhuasted your late days any submission up to 24 hours late will recieve a 50% penalty. Any work submitted after 24 hours will be graded but will not be eligible for any credit.
</ul>

<strong>No late days can be applied to the discussion
assignments</strong> (presenter or non-presenter). If you sign up for
a presenter role and find that you will miss class, you must either
(a) find someone to swap presentation slots with or (b) create the
presentation and find another student to present it for you.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Extensions</h4>
In general, we do not grant extensions on assignments. There are several exceptions:
<ul>
<li>
Medical Emergencies: If you are sick and unable to complete an assignment or attend class, please go to University Health Services. For minor illnesses, we expect grace days or our late penalties to provide sufficient accommodation. For medical emergencies (e.g. prolonged hospitalization), students may request an extension afterwards and should include a note from University Health Services.
<li>
Family/Personal Emergencies: If you have a family emergency (e.g. death in the family) or a personal emergency (e.g. mental health crisis), please contact your academic adviser or Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS). In addition to offering support, they will reach out to the instructors for all your courses on your behalf to request an extension.
<li>
University-Approved Absences: If you are attending an out-of-town university approved event (e.g. multi-day athletic/academic trip organized by the university), you may request an extension for the duration of the trip. You must provide confirmation of your attendance, usually from a faculty or staff organizer of the event.
</ul>
For any of the above situations, you may request an extension by emailing your instructor. The email should be sent as soon as you are aware of the conflict and at least 5 days prior to the deadline. In the case of an emergency, no notice is needed.
</p>

		<h4>Audit Policy</h4>
		Official auditing of the course (i.e. taking the course for an “Audit” grade) is not permitted this semester.<br /> <br />Unofficial auditing of the course (i.e. watching the lectures online or attending them in person) is welcome and permitted without prior approval. Unofficial auditors will not be given access to course materials such as homework assignments and exams.

		<h4>Pass/Fail Policy</h4>
		Pass/Fail is not allowed in this class.

		<h4>Accommodations for Students with
		Disabilities </h4> If you have a disability and have
		an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources
		office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations
		and needs with the instructor as early in the semester
		as possible. I will work with you to ensure that
		accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you
		suspect that you may have a disability and would
		benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered
		with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage
		you to contact them at <a href=
		"mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu">access@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
		
		<h3>Academic Integrity Policies</h3>
		<b>Read this Carefully</b>
		<h4>Collaboration among Students</h4>
		<ul>

		<li><strong>Group project:</strong> Students are
		expected to collaborate with their groupmates on the
		  project and implementation, and this collaboration
		  need not be reported: it is assumed.

		<li><strong>Collaborations outside the group
		  project:</strong> Studying the material in groups is
		  encouraged. It is also allowed to seek help from
		  other students in understanding the material needed
		  to solve a particular homework problem, provided no
		  written notes (including code) are shared, or are
		  taken at that time, and provided learning is
		  facilitated, not circumvented. The actual solution
		  must be done by each student alone.</li>

		<li>The presence or absence of any form of help or
		collaboration, whether given or received, must be
		explicitly stated and disclosed in full by all
		involved. Specifically, each assignment solution must
		include a collaboration section.

		<li>If you gave help after turning in your own
		assignment and/or after answering the collaboration
		section, you must update your answers before the
		assignment’s deadline, if necessary by emailing the
		course staff or a Piazza post.</li>

		<li>Collaboration without full disclosure will be
		handled severely, in compliance with CMU’s Policy
		on <a href=
		"https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html"
		target = "_blank">Academic Integrity.</a>

		  All violations (even first one) of course policies
		  will always be reported to the university
		  authorities (your Department Head, Associate Dean,
		  Dean of Student Affairs, etc.) as an official
		  Academic Integrity Violation and will carry severe
		  penalties. The penalty which will be recommended by
		  the Professor for violation of the academic
		  integrity policy is failure in the course. For
		  repeat offenders, violoation of academic integrity
		  policies can even lead to dismissal from the
		  university.
		</li>

		<li>While students are encouraged to use generative AI
		  tools as resources or as collaborators on a course
		  project, <strong>use of generative AI to produce any
		  part of an assignment (project or presentation)
		  should be documented in the collaboration
		  section.</strong> 

		<li>At the instructor's discretion, any assignments or
		  presentations may also be <strong>supplemented with
		  an oral quiz</strong> in a small group, or
		  one-on-one with the instructor.  One reason for
		  doing this to verify that generative AI has not be
		  over-used, i.e., used to the extent that a student
		  does not fully understand some material that he/she
		  has presented or turned in.

		<li>
		  Students are responsible for proactively protecting
		  their work from copying and misuse by other
		  students. If a student’s work is copied by another
		  student, the original author is also considered to
		  be at fault and in violation of the course
		  policies. 
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Previously used assignments</h4>Some of the
		assignments used in this class may have been used in
		prior versions of this class, or in classes at other
		institutions, or elsewhere. Solutions to them may be,
		or may have been, available online, or from other
		people or sources. It is explicitly forbidden to use
		any such sources, or to consult people who have solved
		these problems before. It is explicitly forbidden to
		search for these problems or their solutions on the
		internet. Only collaboration with other students who are
		currently taking the class is allowed, and only under
		the conditions stated above.
