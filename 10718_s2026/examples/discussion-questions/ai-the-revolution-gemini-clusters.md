The discussion questions from the second file, centered on the article "Artificial Intelligence—The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" by Michael I. Jordan, can be clustered into the following thematic groups:

### 1. Intelligence Augmentation (IA) vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

This group focuses on the author's advocacy for "Intelligence Augmentation" (enhancing human capabilities) over "human-imitative AI," and the practical tensions between these goals.

* Whether the true goal of systems should be replacing or augmenting human decision-making.


* If IA is a transitional stage that will inevitably slide toward full human replacement (AI) due to business logic.


* Whether modern agentic AI or Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to solve the specific IA and II (Intelligent Infrastructure) problems the author identified.


* How recent advancements in reasoning models have challenged or reinforced the claim that IA and II are independent problems to solve.



### 2. AI as a New Engineering Discipline

These questions address the author’s call for a rigorous engineering discipline for "societal-scale inference systems" that currently lacks technical principles.

* Identifying the core abstractions of such a discipline, such as reliability, robustness, and incentive alignment.


* How to facilitate treating AI as an engineering discipline when funding is heavily focused on "superintelligence".


* The risks associated with leaders framing systems as "intelligent" rather than "engineered".


* How to design systems that can detect when they are "untrustable" because training data does not match the current context.


* Methods for empirically validating that engineering ideas for socio-technical systems generalize across different domains.



### 3. Societal Impact, Values, and Ethics

This cluster explores how human values and social sciences should be integrated into AI systems to ensure they are fair and beneficial to society.

* Practical ways to integrate human values into design, such as through product requirements, governance, optimization terms, or post-deployment audits.


* How to incorporate perspectives from the humanities and social sciences into AI development.


* Identifying the optimal, practical problems ML can solve to benefit society the most.


* Whether the "Bitter Lesson" applies to Intelligent Infrastructure—specifically, if learned systems will eventually outperform hand-designed systems for safety and fairness.



### 4. Reliability, Safety, and Human Error

These questions look at the practical application of AI in high-stakes fields like medicine and transportation, where error and accountability are paramount.

* The role AI can play in reducing medical errors caused by human fatigue and imperfect judgment.


* Why there is still limited use of AI in everyday medical practice despite its significant potential.


* The psychological discrepancy in why society is terrified of a single robot crash but often ignores thousands of human-caused crashes.


* Whether we should forgive AI for making "weirder" mistakes than humans if it overall makes fewer mistakes.


* What specific factors (provenance, shift checks, utility functions, etc.) must be validated before system deployment.



### 5. Theoretical Foundations vs. Empirical Progress

This group examines the tension between data-driven empirical success and the need for underlying explanatory principles.

* Whether current data-driven approaches are an early phase that will eventually lead to theoretical explanatory principles.


* Whether the focus on data-driven infrastructure is fundamentally the wrong path compared to focusing on theory.


* How to distinguish between incremental engineering advances and genuine scientific revolutions in AI.



### 6. The Definition and Future of AGI

This cluster deals with the definition of "intelligence" and whether pursuing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains a meaningful goal.

* The confusion between marketing success and scientific revolution, noting that "AI" today is mostly statistical machine learning rather than autonomous reasoning.


* Whether pursuing AGI is still a meaningful goal and how it would behave differently from powerful infrastructural systems.


* If intelligence is not the primary problem to solve, what researchers should focus on instead.



### 7. Modern Reflections on 2019 Perspectives

Since the source article predates the "LLM revolution," these questions ask how the author's views might have shifted.

* How the author might feel differently today about progress in human-imitative AI.


* Whether progress in robotics or generative AI would be enough to change the author's opinion on the limitations of accountability and interpretability.
