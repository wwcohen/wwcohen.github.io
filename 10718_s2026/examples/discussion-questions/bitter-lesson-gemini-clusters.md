Based on the provided text, the discussion questions regarding "The Bitter Lesson" can be clustered into the following thematic groups:

### 1. The Role and Definition of Human Knowledge

This group explores the tension between "baked-in" human knowledge and general-purpose methods, and whether human priors remain useful as starting points.

* How to distinguish between "human knowledge baked in" versus a "general method" within a specific domain.


* Whether there is a meaningful distinction between "human knowledge" and "inductive bias" in the context of the Bitter Lesson.


* Which parts of human reasoning are considered too complex to encode directly.


* Determining the line between acceptable "built-in" meta-methods and human-centric knowledge that risks creating incorrect abstractions.


* Whether a human prior serves as a valuable starting point, such as training on human data before performing Reinforcement Learning.



### 2. Physical, Economic, and Computational Limits

These questions challenge the Bitter Lesson's reliance on Moore's Law and explore what happens if the exponential growth of compute or high-quality data hits a ceiling.

* Whether the Bitter Lesson remains valid if Moore's Law slows down or high-quality data becomes a bottleneck.


* The impact on AI research methodology if compute growth slows dramatically due to fundamental limits or policy restrictions.


* Whether domain knowledge becomes useful again if a compute stall lasts for decades.


* If physical and environmental limits, such as massive energy consumption, will eventually force a return to efficiency and human knowledge.



### 3. Safety, Trust, and Interpretability

This cluster focuses on the conflict between high-performing "inhuman" algorithms and the human need for systems that are reliable, explainable, and safe.

* Whether the Bitter Lesson holds when success is defined by safety, reliability, and accountability rather than just performance.


* The difficulty of trusting or validating discoveries made through statistical pattern-matching that differs from human reasoning.


* Whether the Bitter Lesson implies that AI interpretability is a "losing battle".


* The concern that "inhuman" algorithms make accountability and oversight difficult.


* The ongoing need for human domain experts to validate that a system is learning correctly rather than finding bad correlations.



### 4. Practical Engineering and Real-World Constraints

These questions address the limitations of the Bitter Lesson for teams operating under fixed resources or in specific domains where scaling has not yet dominated.

* The mismatch between the Bitter Lesson and engineering teams that must ship systems under fixed compute and time constraints.


* The necessity of human-designed heuristics in practical, safety-critical applications like autonomous vehicles.


* How the Bitter Lesson relates to domains like tabular data, where tree methods and feature engineering often still outperform deep learning.



### 5. Evolution of Research Methods and Frameworks

This group discusses how researchers should evaluate complexity and which current AI trends might eventually be viewed as "bitter lessons."

* How researchers should justify adding complexity to new methods and what evidence would warrant it.


* Identifying current research directions (e.g., in LLM and agent ecosystems) that may deliver short-term wins but fail to scale.


* Whether current methods exist to incorporate domain knowledge without blocking generalizability or scalability.


* What changes to funding, benchmarks, and publication norms would better reward compute-scalable approaches.



### 6. Modern AI Architectures (LLMs and Foundation Models)

This cluster applies the 2019 essay's logic to the current era of foundation models and RLHF.

* Whether the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) violates the principles of the Bitter Lesson.


* If foundation models support the idea that search is as important as learning, or if learning has surpassed search in importance.
