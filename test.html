I have extensive experience in machine learning and discovery,
information retrieval, information extraction, and data integration.

<h3 class="sec">Biography</h3 class="sec">

William Cohen received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> in 1984, and a PhD
in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers
University</a> in 1990.  From 1990 to 2000 Dr. Cohen worked at AT&T <a
href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a> and later <a
href="http://www.research.att.com">AT&T Labs-Research</a>, and from
April 2000 to May 2002 Dr. Cohen worked at <a
href="http://www.whizbang.com">Whizbang Labs</a>, a company
specializing in extracting information from the web.  Dr. Cohen is
member of the board of the <a
href="http://www.machinelearning.org/">International Machine Learning
Society</a>, and has served as an action editor for the <a
href="http://www.jmlr.org"><i>Journal of Machine Learning
Research</i></a>, the journal <a
href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~fprovost/MLJ/"><i>Machine
Learning</i></a> and the <a href="http://www.jair.org"><i>Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research</i></a>. He was Program Co-Chair of the 
<a href="http://www.icml2006.org">2006 International Machine Learning Conference</a>
and Co-Chair of the <a
href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/pub/learning94/learning94.html">1994
International Machine Learning Conference</a>, and has served on more than 20
program committees or advisory committees.

<p>
Dr. Cohen's research interests include information integration and
machine learning, particularly information extraction, text
categorization and learning from large datasets. He holds seven
patents related to learning, discovery, information retrieval, and
data integration, and is the author of more than 100 publications.

<h3 class="sec"><a name="proj">Projects</a></h3 class="sec">

I'm currently involved with:
<ul>

<li><a href="http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/services/SLIF2/">SLIF</a>, a system that analyzes the text and images
in online journal articles to find information about the subcellular localization of proteins.

<li><a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/project/CALO">CALO</a> and <a
href="http://radar.cs.cmu.edu">RADAR</a>, two large projects focused on
intelligent agents for office automation.

<li><a href="http://www.learnlab.org/">The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center</a>,
notably in a project to add learning-by-demonstration to <a href="http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu/">CTAT</a>.
</ul>

<h3 class="sec"><a name="sw">Software systems</a></h3 class="sec">

<ul>
<li>My latest baby is <a
href="http://minorthird.sourceforge.net">Minorthird</a>, an
open-source Java package of information extraction and text
classification learning tools.  
<p>
I am now distributing a standalone tool, built on Minorthird, for
annotating biomedical text.  This is particularly aimed at annotating
figure captions but might be useful for other text as well.  The <a
href="slifTextComponent-v1.0.jar">jar file</a> for this is rather large
(17M), as it includes a Minorthird jar.  There is <a
href="SlifTextComponent.html">documentation available</a> for this,
and some <a href="captions.tgz">sample data</a>.

<p>
My student Vitor Carvalho distributes the poetically named <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/codeAndData.html">Jangada</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/codeAndData.html">Ciranda</a>,
which are also standalone apps built on top of Minorthird, to analyze
email messages.

<li>
Here's a <a href="http://yeast.ml.cmu.edu/rase">cool demo</a> of a
Google-Sets-like bootstrapping tool written by my student <a
href="http://rcwang.com">Richard Wang</a>.


<li>
<a href="http://secondstring.sourceforge.net">SecondString</a> is
another open-source Java package, of approximate string matching
techniques.

<li><a href="slipper/">SLIPPER</a> and <a href="whirl/">WHIRL</a> are
now being distributed via Rutgers University.  They are free for research
purposes.

<li>To get a copy of RIPPER, please send mail to my evil twin brother,
wcohen -AT- gmail.com.  

As an alternative to that ancient code: I haven't used it myself, but
I've heard good things about
<a href="http://www.oefai.at/~alexsee/WEKA/doc/weka.classifiers.rules.JRip.html">
J-RIP</a>, a Ripper clone written for WEKA.
</ul>

<h3 class="sec"><a name="data">Datasets</a></h3 class="sec">

The following datasets are available for anyone to use for research
purposes:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/codeAndData.html">617
messages from 20 Newsgroups, annotated for reply bodies and
signatures</a>, prepared by my student <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor">Vitor Carvalho</a>

<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~einat/datasets.html">
Two subsets of the Enron data, annotated with person names</a>,
prepared by my student <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~einat">Einat
Minkov</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron">Enron email dataset</a>
(400Mb, once you get there) contains 800,000+ emails from 150 users+
organized into 4700+ folders.

<li><a href="doj-email.xls">Some more email data</a>: about two
thousand messages released to the public as part of the ongoing <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_e-mail_controversy">investigation
of US Attorney firings at the Dept of Justice</a>.  This is very
strange data---the original email is released as scanned printouts in
PDF (?!), so most of the text is not available.  There are links to
copies of the PDF, some manually added annotations, and a (apparently
manually-reconstructed) social network graph.  About 1.5Mb (in Excel
format).  From <a
href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/5/21/12120/5682">Mark
Johnson, and a network of volunteers.</a>


<li><a href="repository.tgz">A collection of various extraction datasets
in Minorthird format</a> (6Mb), including about 1000 Enron emails tagged
for person names and temporal expressions.

<li><a href="classify.tar.gz">classify.tar.gz</a> (0.4Mb) contains
nine problems in which the goal is to classify short entity names.
This data was used in <i>Joins that Generalize: Text Classification
Using WHIRL</i> (KDD-98).

<li><a href="ranking-data.tar.gz">ranking.tar.gz</a> (8Mb) contains the
data used for the meta-search experiments in my JAIR paper <a
href="http://www.jair.org/abstracts/cohen99a.html">Learning to Order
Things</a> (with Rob Schapire and Yoram Singer).

<li><a href="match.tar.gz">match.tar.gz</a> (0.7Mb) contains a suite of
<i>labeled</i> entity-name matching and clustering problems
(i.e. problems for which the correct matches/clusters are provided),
in a single consistent format. In most cases WHIRL's performance is
given as a benchmark.

<p>These are also distributed in the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/riddle/data.html">RIDDLE
Repository</a>.  Extraction-oriented versions of some of this data are
available on the <a
href="http://www.isi.edu/info-agents/RISE/repository.html">RISE
Repository</a>. (I.e., represented as a problem of extracting data from
a website, rather than matching two datasets).

  <li>Download the <a href="minorthird.jar">jar for minorThird</a>
    and stick it in some directory.

  <li>Change to that same directory and
  then run Minorthird with the command <br>
  <code>java -Xmx500M -jar minorthird.jar</code>

  <p>
  What will pop up will be a small launch pad that can be used to 
  start any of the UI programs.  You can also start a particular

<p>Obscure fact: two of my papers made the Citeseer's list of <a
href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/MachineLearning/">most-cited machine learning  papers</a>.

<p>For those many friends whose research I have built on, be warned.
My full name, "William Weston Cohen", is an anagram of the phrase "I
now cite shallow men".  (From <a
href="http://iew3.technion.ac.il/~sarac/">Sara Cohen</a> - no
relation! - comes this warning: "Women's rights activists would
probably request you to use the following anagram instead: 'I shall
now cite women'".)

<p>I am often praised for my highly artistic and functional web site
designs.  An example is the site for <a
href="http://www.scindexing.com">SC Indexing, a professional book
indexer</a>.  However, I accept few clients - this one happens to be
<a href="http://www.scindexing.com">my wife</a>.

<p>Through my advisor, Alex Borgida, I can trace my <a

Leibniz and Alfred Whitehead.
