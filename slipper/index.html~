    <h1>The SLIPPER Rule Learning System</h1>

    <p>
    SLIPPER is a rule-learning system.  Formally, it is based on <a
    href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~singer/papers/impbst.ps.gz">confidence-rated
    boosting</a>, a variant of AdaBoost developed by <a
    href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/">Rob Schapire</a> and
    <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~singer/">Yoram Singer</a> in
    1999.  The code is based on <a href="http://wcohen.com">William
    Cohen's</a> widely-used <a
    href="http://wcohen.com/postscript/ml-95-ripper.ps">RIPPER</a>
    learning system. A detailed description of the SLIPPER algorithm
    can be found in a technical paper by Cohen and Singer in AAAI-99,
    titled <a href="http://wcohen.com/postscript/aaai-99-slipper.ps">A
    Simple, Fast, and Effective Rule Learner</a>.

    <p>Like RIPPER, SLIPPER is fast, robust, and easy to use, and its
    hypotheses are compact and easy to understand. Like RIPPER,
    SLIPPER supports <a
    href="http://wcohen.com/postscript/aaai-96.ps">set-valued
    features</a>, which makes it useful for text categorization using
    a "bag of words" representation of text.  Unlike RIPPER, SLIPPER
    is unencumbered by patent constraints, and it is freely available
    for research purposes.

    <p><a
    href="http://software.cs.rutgers.edu/slipper/slipper_license.html">A
    version of SLIPPER suitable for academic and research use</a> can
    be downloaded from Rutgers University.  (Thanks to <a
    href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~hirsh/">Haym Hirsh</a> for making
    this legally possible.)  It is available as C source code,
    compiling under the GNU C compiler, or as executables for Linux or
    Windows. (For Windows, <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
    must be installed.  Cygwin is a free package of Unix-compatible
    tools and libraries.)
