<h3>Biography</h3>

William Cohen received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
<a href="http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> in 1984, and a PhD
in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers
University</a> in 1990.  From 1990 to 2000 Dr. Cohen worked at AT&T <a
href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a> and later <a
href="http://www.research.att.com">AT&T Labs-Research</a>, and from
April 2000 to May 2002 Dr. Cohen worked at <a
href="http://www.whizbang.com">Whizbang Labs</a>, a company
specializing in extracting information from the web.  Dr. Cohen is
currently an action editor for the <a
href="http://www.jmlr.org"><i>Journal of Machine Learning
Research</i></a>, has served as an editor for the journal <a
href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~holte/mlj/"><i>Machine
Learning</i></a> and the <a href="http://www.jair.org"><i>Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research</i></a>, co-organized the 1994
International Machine Learning Conference, and has served on more than
20 program committees or advisory committees.  In addition to 
his position at CMU, Dr. Cohen also serves on the advisory board of 
<a href="http://www.intelliseek.com">Intelliseek</a>.

<p>
Dr. Cohen's research
interests include information integration and machine learning,
particularly text categorization and learning from large datasets. He
holds six patents related to learning, discovery, information
retrieval, and data integration, and is the author of more than 60
refereed publications.

<h3><a name="sw">Software systems</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>My
latest baby is <a
href="http://minorthird.sourceforge.net">Minorthird</a>,
an open-source Java package of information extraction 
and text classification learning tools.

<li>
<a href="http://secondstring.sourceforge.net">SecondString</a> is
another open-source Java package, of approximate string matching
techniques.

<li><a href="slipper/">SLIPPER</a> and <a href="whirl/">WHIRL</a> are
now being distributed via Rutgers University.  They are free for research
purposes.

<li>Send me email to find out how to get a copy of RIPPER.  

As an alternative to that ancient code: I haven't used it myself, but
I've heard good things about
<a href="http://www.oefai.at/~alexsee/WEKA/doc/weka.classifiers.rules.JRip.html">
J-RIP</a>, a Ripper clone written for WEKA.
</ul>

<h3><a name="data">Datasets</a></h3>

The following datasets are available for anyone to use for research
purposes:
<ul>
<li><a href="classify.tar.gz">classify.tar.gz</a> (0.4Mb) contains
nine problems in which the goal is to classify short entity names.
This data was used in <i>Joins that Generalize: Text Classification
Using WHIRL</i> (KDD-98).

<li><a href="match.tar.gz">match.tar.gz</a> (0.7Mb) contains a suite of
<i>labeled</i> entity-name matching and clustering problems
(i.e. problems for which the correct matches/clusters are provided),
in a single consistent format. In most cases with WHIRL's
performance is given as a benchmark.

<li><a href="ranking-data.tar.gz">ranking.tar.gz</a> (8Mb) contains the
data used for the meta-search experiments in my JAIR paper <a
href="http://www.jair.org/abstracts/cohen99a.html">Learning to Order
Things</a> (with Rob Schapire and Yoram Singer).

<h3><a name="teach">Teaching</a></h3>

June 21,23,25: A mini-course on Minorthird.  
<p>

Materials:
<ul>

<li><a href="day1.tgz">Slides, notes, and sample files from first
day's lecture</a>.

<li><a href="day2.tgz">Slides, notes, and sample files from second
day's lecture</a>.

<li><a href="day3.ppt">Powerpoint slides from third
day's lecture</a>.

<li><a href="minorthird.jar">Jar file for minorThird</a>, if you
only want to run the code, not compile it or read it.
The installation process here is:
  <ol>
  <li>Install Java 1.4 or higher (actually, JRE is all you need).
  <li>Download the <a href="minorthird.jar">jar for minorThird</a>
    and stick it in some directory.
  <li>Optionally, download the <a href="repository.tgz">sample data
  repository</a> and unpack it into the same directory.
  <li>Change to that same directory and
  then run Minorthird with the command <br>
  <code>java -Xmx500M -jar minorthird.jar</code>

  <p>
  What will pop up will be a small launch pad that can be used to 
  start any of the UI programs.  You can also start a particular
  main by specifying minorthird.jar as your classpath, for 
  instance: <br>

  <code>java -Xmx500M -cp minorthird.jar edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.Help</code>
  </ol>

<li>If you want to do a real install here's the <a
href="http://minorthird.sourceforge.net">home page on Sourceforge</a>, and
a document on <a href="10-707/QUICKSTART.txt">how to do a CVS
install Minorthird</a>.
</ul>

distributed.

<li><a href="pubs.html">All publications</a>. Here is an more-or-less
complete chronological list of my publications.  The bibliography
includes pointers to on-line versions when I can provide them, but
unfortunately copyright restrictions don't allow me to make all of my
publications available on-line.  Of course, reprints are always
available from me on request.

Recent papers I'm keeping in HTML or PDF (which requires <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe
Acrobat Reader</a> to view).  Older papers are mostly in Postscript.
For Windows, I use the <a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/">GSView</a> reader for
postscript.  Most of these papers are viewable in several formats in
<a href="http://www.researchindex.com">ResearchIndex</a>.

<h3><a name="misc">Other Stuff</a></h3>

<p>For those many friends whose research I have built on, be warned.
My full name, "William Weston Cohen", is an anagram of the phrase "I now
cite shallow men".

<p>I am often praised for my highly artistic and functional web site designs.
An example is the site for <a href="http://www.scindexing.com">SC Indexing,
a professional book indexer</a>.  However, I accept few clients - this
one happens to be my wife.

<p>Through my advisor, Alex Borgida, I can trace my <a
href="lineage.html">"academic lineage"</a> back to luminaries like
Leibniz and Alfred Whitehead.
