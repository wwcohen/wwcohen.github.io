<h2>Chronology of revisions and discussions</h2>

<ul>
<li>V1 <a href="thesis-as-defended.pdf">Thesis as defended</a> on May
20th.  The main content of the thesis has been published as six
conference papers in several different good AI/ITS conferences: ECML,
AIED, ECAI, EDM, and twice in ITS.

<li><a href="#post-defense-revisions">Requested revisions</a>, cc-d to Pat, May 20th.
<li><a href="#revision-plan-1">Nan's announced revisions</a>, sent to Ken and William May 23 for discussion.
<li><a href="#revisions-plan-sent-to-pat">Nan's planned revisions</a>, sent to Pat May 23, along with
 some <a href="pdf-attachments-for-revision-plan.zip">PDF figures</a>.  
<li>V2 <a href="thesis-round1-revised.pdf">revised thesis</a>, sent to Pat</a> May 29.
We pinged him June 4 and Jun 12, then Jun 18, then July 1, and finally called him via phone shortly after July 1.
<li><a href="#second-round-of-requests">Pat's second round of requests, July 5,</a> which raises five new issues 
to be addressed separtely in "each chapter" and for "each subsystem", and alludes to other "minor comments".
Pat <a href="#doesnt-think">"doesn't think"</a> these are new requests.
<li><The same day <a href="#ken-complains">Ken complains about the scope and timing
of the new requests</a>, starting off an discussion that becomes acrimonious.
<li>July 7, <a href="#second-round-of-requests-part-2">Pat makes his
requests less general</a>, and <a href="#how-related">clarifies how
they relate</a> to the original list of revisions requested on May 20;
objecting to "shallow and unscholarly" text, lack of a "unified
description", and provides a <a href="#detailed-list">more detailed
list</a> of specific changes to make.  He estimates these are 11
paragraphs and <a href="#two-days">two days of work</a>.
<li>July 8, Ken and I approve the <a href="#second-round-oked">latest
round of revisions</a> for Nan.  Around the same time, on July 10,
William contacts Srini with an update on the process and my concerns,
and sends Pat some email on July 11, to try and make the discussion
less acrimonious.
<li>V3 July 13, Nan sends Pat a list of <a href="#more-planned-changes">planned changes</a> in responds to the July 7 requests.
<li>July 15, Pat responds with a short email and
a <a href="pats-comments-july-15.txt">long list objections</a> to
these changes, bringing us to V4 at least. Among the concerns, Pat
says Nan "doesn't understand what I'm asking" in several places, again
asking for a discussion of psychological claims, and rejecting many of
the proposed revisions.  The same
day, <a href="#william-objects">William objects to the objections</a>,
mainly due the apparent lack of convergence, and proposes some
compromise revisions that he feels are doable, well-defined, and hence
will lead to convergence in V4.
<li>July 18, <a href="#pat-replies-to-objections">Pat responds to
William's objections</a>:
<ul>
<li>William asked for, as a principle, "a clearly defined, finite,
extensional list of things to fix", that doesn't require
"generalizing" from Pat's comments.  Pat rejects this, but proposes 
a new scheme for iterating over comments/proposed revisions.
<li>Pat agrees to have discussion of theory/implementation be in one
place.
<li>Pat does not agree to operationalize this disussion as William suggested.
<li>In response to William's request for examples of acceptable
theory/implementation discussion, Pat proposes: Langley, P., &
Ohlsson, S. (1984); Li, N., Stracuzzi, D. J., & Langley, P. (2012);
and Quinlan's 1986 MLJ decision-tree paper.
<li>Pat rejects the proposal to pick one or two design alternatives to discuss.
<li>Pat rejects William's proposed template for related work discussion, which was
intended to avoid open-ended requests for additional discussion.
</ul>
The same day, William responded to Pat's email, expressing my concerns
about repeated micro-iterations (his proposal), summarizing his
response, asking if he can think of any other way to resolve the
disagreement, and asking for clarification of a philosophy-of-science
type dispute which underlies (I think) our disagreement.
</ul>
<li>July 17, we agree to deadlines of 7/22 for requests and 7/26 for
revisions.  William sends a note to Pat discussing the schedule -
there's also a phone call.  William proposes
a <a href="#new-procedure">procedure</a> for handling the deadline.

Dear Nan and committee,

Congratulations on the your successful thesis defense talk!

We would like some revisions to your thesis document before signing off it. Below are the agreed upon thesis document change requests (and notes on the questions and on my detailed notes on the talk).

Ken

Suggestions for thesis document revisions from committee deliberation:

1) Compare using AFM to original SimStudent.

2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

3) Add a "big picture" diagram in intro
Have visualization of the relationships between the parts of the thesis, parts of SimStudent learning, parts of performance representation (production system).    Make a "big picture" and a subsection describing it.   Put perhaps at end of chapter 1 (or after SimStudent description)

Clarify the 3 different kinds of models/systems and how they are related.  What feeds into what and which parts are done and which are planned.

Clarify  how the (various components of the) performance system use the learned results of the various learning mechanisms

4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end
Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas already existed (with references) and which parts are new.
- Another possible organizational strategy (besides big picture): Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and the human learning goals. (Does going for both improve the other?)
- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems solved -- more unified description.

6) Motivate and make more clear what the research questions and hypotheses that each experiment is addressingbefore presenting experimental results

----
Questions after talk:

Ray: *About the comparison to the hand model to extended SimStudent -- what about adding an original SimStudent  to the human students?**
*
Pat: Distinguish between theoretical claims and the implementations that you have done.  Theory parts -- 1) human cognition adopted vs. 2) new theory.  Tease A1, A2 and B apart.

Is rep learning only in grammars (similar to perceptual hierarchy in Icarus) or also in discrimination trees (similar to concept hierarchy in Icarus & features from grammar tree

[Me: Perceptual rep learning is a crucial part of human skill learning.]

Tom: Interested in ideas about representation learning.  It is interesting that you used this temporal adjacency -- could you shift this around and change how people learn?

[Could give example from Landy & Goldstone where distance between terms (structural not temporal).]

Give an example of a fourth domain?
[Me: Chess (as well as the diagram example) are good ones where distant elements (an attacking bishop across from a pawn) are to be chucked.]

Ray:  pCFG training
*Hard EM (not "Viterbi training") vs. inside-outside.  Why does the 1st work better?**
*
Ray: constructing grammar by fixing number of non-terminals.

Pat: About the claim that this is a model of human learning.  There is an inherent tension as a knowledge acquisition tool vs. a model student learning.  Have you compared the kinds of errors produced by SimStudent to those of students?

Pat: Three kinds of models/systems: Computational model of student learning, personalized tutoring systems, learned model

Ken Q: Is the rep learning monotonic such that skills learned a more primitive representation do not need to be thrown not  with skill?

--------
My notes on the talk:
S2-3: Nice  -- I'd use the term "apprentice" in addition to "student".
S4-9: Perhaps a bit long to get to your main point
S10: Very good -- you caught the audience's attention

S14: You use "intelligent agent" in two different ways -- here as a learning agent (=SimStudent), but earlier as a performance agent (cognitive model or expert system)

S15: Saying "recently" for classification is not quite right ...

S17: Playing the demo was a little rough -- doing the separate pieces of the video in separate slides (as we discussed, but I understand your limited time) would be great for future talks.  (The second mouse from you was a little confusing.)

S22: You did this important result slide too fast.   Describe the graph key, point to individual lines, indicate the results work across domains (say what they are), emphasize that is an important new outcome.

S43: Might show the usual WME representation of this interface before showing the parse tree.

S44: Was hard to follow.

S45: Replace "a layout" with a "parse tree" ...

S47: /How come the 2nd expr associated with the 1st expr rather than with the Ski//?/

S52: THis is S22 again I see.  Maybe you said (and I missed) at S22 that you would show this slide again.

S61: Was again too fast.  You want to dramatize the importance here.

S66: Want to emphasize if the skills are different, the hints and

/Pat: //Where do the buggy rules come from?/

S66-68: YOu might first emphasize the engineering win of SimStudent -- that cognitive models for tutors (the hardest part) can be developed without AI programming (by a subject-matter expert).  And, then, indicate that models

S70: Lots of questions here ...

S69:  You didn't describe what an "opportunity" is.

Hi Ken and William,

Here is the list of things that I plan to change in my thesis. Please take a look and let me know your thoughts on it. Thanks!

Best,
Nan

1) Compare using AFM to original SimStudent.

Will add a subsection in Chapter 8 (8.7) to compare the original SimStudent with the new SimStudent in algebra domain.

 

2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

1.    In Chapter 2, add a subsection that describes SimStudent’s performance system

a.    How working memory is organized as a hierarchy

b.    How production rules are matched with the working memory as well as feature tests

2.    In Chapter 3, make it clear that the representation learning algorithm mentioned here is a stand-alone module that is not yet integrated into SimStudent

3.    In Chapter 1, after adding the “big picture” diagram in comment 3, add a subsection that describes the role of perceptual representation learning in skill learning

a.    High-level, representation learning presents features for learning algorithms

b.    SimStudent specific

                                              i.     Acquires and extends working memory hierarchy to replace manually constructed working memory (where), and feature extraction operator functions (how)

                                             ii.     Automatically generates feature predicates for when learning

 

3) Add a "big picture" diagram in intro

Have visualization of the relationships between the parts of the thesis, parts of SimStudent learning, parts of performance representation (production system).    Make a "big picture" and a subsection describing it.   Put perhaps at end of chapter 1 (or after SimStudent description)

 

Clarify the 3 different kinds of models/systems and how they are related.  What feeds into what and which parts are done and which are planned.

 

Clarify  how the (various components of the) performance system use the learned results of the various learning mechanisms

1.    One big picture diagram that relates, SimStudent, Cognitive Model, Model Tracing + Knowledge Tracing in cognitive tutors

2.    One more focused diagram on SimStudent that relates, where, when, and how learning with perceptual representation learning

 

4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end

Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas already existed (with references) and which parts are new.

- Another possible organizational strategy (besides big picture): Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and the human learning goals. (Does going for both improve the other?)

- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

Not so sure about this part, should we remove all of the related work section and combine them into a big one at the end?

 

5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems solved -- more unified description.

Repeatedly referring back the big diagram at the start of each chapter

 

6) Motivate and make more clear what the research questions and hypotheses that each experiment is addressing before presenting experimental results

Add a subsection in the experimental results section stating the hypothesis

1.    For Chapter 4, 5, 6, and 7, the hypothesis would be whether the SimStudent with representation learning can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

2.    For Chapter 8, the hypothesis would be whether the extended SimStudent can be used to discover learner models than are better than human-generated models

a.    The additional subsection is to test how representation learning affects the quality of the learner model discovered by SimStudent

These seem appropriate to me.  After we've converged (you me and Ken) we should send it to Pat for his comments.

See below for answers to question:



4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end

I think there's room for two types discussions of related work.  Work that is narrowly specific to the work in a chapter - e.g., ordering FOIL rules in the article selection, or 2-d grammars - should still be discussed there.  Work that's more broadly relevant to the entire SimStudent project (eg other cognitive architectures) can be discussed after the summary discussion of SimStudent.  Work that's broadly related to your represention learning results (maybe Stolke's thesis, maybe deep belief nets, etc) could be discussed after you introduce the "big picture" overview of the thesis.
 
 

5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems solved -- more unified description.

Repeatedly referring back the big diagram at the start of each chapter


... and enforce some more uniformity of  style, eg consistently stating hypotheses.

Hi Ken and William,

These are my first try on the big picture diagram as well as the SimStudent diagram. The red parts are the extensions we made to the whole system as well as to SimStudent.

It seems representation learning is missing in the Simstudent diagram. Also, the then part is in the wrong place.

In Chpt 1 you can also anticipate the comments below by saying something like: "One of the distinctive elements of SimStudent and my extensions to it is the emphasis on perceptual information retrieval (a separate part of production rule if-parts described in section X.X) and perceptual learning (where and what learning described in section X.X).

b.    Other representation learning (e.g., Stolcky’s thesis, DBN)

                                              i.     This may belong to the specific related work for representation learning

 

5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems solved -- more unified description.

Repeatedly referring back the big diagram at the start of each chapter and enforce some more uniformity of style, eg consistently stating hypotheses.

Hi Ken and William,

This is the version that I just updated. Please take a quick look at it, and then I will send it to Pat. Thanks.

This emphasis is important because ... [refs to perceptual chunking, Chi].  It is different from other cognitive architectures as most of the existing cognitive architectures do not distinguish perceptual knowledge from conceptual knowledge.

- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

1.     Add a list of related work that’s more broadly relevant to the SimStudent project, rather than a specific component, and discuss how my work relates to other existing work

a.     Grammar learning (e.g., Stolcky’s thesis): Mostly focus on grammar induction, not applied to perceptual learning

b.     Perceptual learning (e.g., DBN): Stand alone module, models specific aspects of human learning (classification)

c.     Other representation learning mechanism: More focused on conceptual knowledge learning rather than perceptual learning, and most of them are not integrated in a learning agent

d.     Other cognitive architectures: We are the first that models perceptual learning, and integrate it into skill learning

e.     Student model: More focused on modeling student errors based on human student behavior, but has not matched the model with student learning curve data.

 

5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems solved -- more unified description.

Repeatedly referring back the big diagram at the start of each chapter and enforce some more uniformity of style, eg consistently stating hypotheses.

 

6) Motivate and make more clear what the research questions and hypotheses that each experiment is addressing before presenting experimental results

Add a subsection in the experimental results section stating the hypothesis

1.     For Chapter 4, 5, 6, and 7, the hypothesis would be whether the SimStudent with representation learning can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

2.     For Chapter 8, the hypothesis would be whether the extended SimStudent can be used to discover learner models than are better than human-generated models

a.     The additional subsection is to test how representation learning affects the quality of the learner model discovered by SimStudent

Hi Pat, Ken and William,

Here is my modification plan for the thesis. Please take a look at it and let me know if you think it is ok. Thanks a lot.

Best,
Nan

1) Compare using AFM to original SimStudent.

Will add a subsection in Chapter 8 (8.7) to compare the original SimStudent with the new SimStudent in algebra domain.

 

2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

1.     In Chapter 1, clearly state that "One of the distinctive elements of SimStudent and my extensions to it is the emphasis on perceptual information retrieval (a separate part of production rule if-parts described in section X.X) and perceptual learning (where and what learning described in section X.X).  This emphasis is important because ... [refs to perceptual chunking, Chi].  It is different from other cognitive architectures as most of the existing cognitive architectures do not distinguish perceptual knowledge from conceptual knowledge. Icarus does have a perceptual memory and a conceptual knowledge base, but it focuses more on concept knowledge learning [refs to Li’s master work], and does not model perceptual learning.”

2.     In Chapter 2, add a subsection that describes SimStudent’s performance system

a.     How working memory is organized as a hierarchy

b.     How production rules are matched with the working memory as well as feature tests

c.     Differentiate the two different parts of the if-parts

3.     In Chapter 3, make it clear that the representation learning algorithm mentioned here is a stand-alone module that is not yet integrated into SimStudent

4.     In Chapter 1, after adding the “big picture” diagram in comment 3, add a subsection that describes the role of perceptual representation learning in skill learning

a.     High-level, representation learning presents features for learning algorithms

b.     SimStudent specific

                                               i.     Acquires and extends working memory hierarchy to replace manually constructed working memory (where), and feature extraction operator functions (how)

                                              ii.     Automatically generates feature predicates for when learning

 

3) Add a "big picture" diagram in intro

Have visualization of the relationships between the parts of the thesis, parts of SimStudent learning, parts of performance representation (production system).    Make a "big picture" and a subsection describing it.   Put perhaps at end of chapter 1 (or after SimStudent description)

 

Clarify the 3 different kinds of models/systems and how they are related.  What feeds into what and which parts are done and which are planned.

 

Clarify  how the (various components of the) performance system use the learned results of the various learning mechanisms

1.     One big picture diagram that relates, SimStudent, Cognitive Model, Model Tracing + Knowledge Tracing in cognitive tutors

2.     One more focused diagram on SimStudent that relates, where, when, and how learning with perceptual representation learning

 

4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end

Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas already existed (with references) and which parts are new.

- Another possible organizational strategy (besides big picture): Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and the human learning goals. (Does going for both improve the other?)

- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

1.     Add a list of related work that’s more broadly relevant to the SimStudent project, rather than a specific component, and discuss how my work relates to other existing work

Hi Pat,

I have made changes to my thesis according to the plan. I am attaching the updated thesis as well as the plan, which points to the sections where I have made changes.

1) Compare using AFM to original SimStudent.

(Section 8.6) Will add a subsection in Chapter 8 to compare the original SimStudent with the new SimStudent in algebra domain.

 

2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

1.     (The end of page 4) In Chapter 1, clearly state that "One of the distinctive elements of SimStudent and my extensions to it is the emphasis on perceptual information retrieval (a separate part of production rule if-parts described in section X.X) and perceptual learning (where and what learning described in section X.X).  This emphasis is important because ... [refs to perceptual chunking, Chi].

3) Add a "big picture" diagram in intro

Have visualization of the relationships between the parts of the thesis, parts of SimStudent learning, parts of performance representation (production system).    Make a "big picture" and a subsection describing it.   Put perhaps at end of chapter 1 (or after SimStudent description)

 

Clarify the 3 different kinds of models/systems and how they are related.  What feeds into what and which parts are done and which are planned.

 

Clarify  how the (various components of the) performance system use the learned results of the various learning mechanisms

3.     (Figure 1.2) One more focused diagram on cognitive tutors

 

4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end

Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas already existed (with references) and which parts are new.

- Another possible organizational strategy (besides big picture): Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and the human learning goals. (Does going for both improve the other?)

- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

1.     (Chapter 9) Add a list of related work that’s more broadly relevant to the SimStudent project, rather than a specific component, and discuss how my work relates to other existing work

(Figure 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, and discussion about these figures) Repeatedly referring back the big diagram at the start of each chapter and enforce some more uniformity of style, eg consistently stating hypotheses.

 

6) Motivate and make more clear what the research questions and hypotheses that each experiment is addressing before presenting experimental results

Add a subsection in the experimental results section stating the hypothesis

Pat,

We would like to sign off on Nan's revisions by the end of the week.  Can you have comments for her in the next day or two?

I have reviewed these changes and given Nan some comments on refinements, but it looks in range for completion.

        learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in
        SimStudent/

        1.In Chapter 1, clearly state that "One of the distinctive

        elements of SimStudent and my extensions to it is the emphasis
        on perceptual information retrieval (a separate part of
        production rule if-parts described in section X.X) and
        perceptual learning (where and what learning described in
        section X.X).This emphasis is important because ... [refs to
        perceptual chunking, Chi].It is different from other cognitive

        architectures as most of the existing cognitive architectures
        do not distinguish perceptual knowledge from conceptual
        knowledge. Icarus does have a perceptual memory and a
        conceptual knowledge base, but it focuses more on concept
        knowledge learning [refs to Li’s master work], and does not
        model perceptual learning.”

        2.In Chapter 2, add a subsection that describes SimStudent’s
        performance system

        a.How working memory is organized as a hierarchy

        b.How production rules are matched with the working memory as
        well as feature tests

        c.Differentiate the two different parts of the if-parts

        3.In Chapter 3, make it clear that the representation learning

        algorithm mentioned here is a stand-alone module that is not
        yet integrated into SimStudent

        4.In Chapter 1, after adding the “big picture” diagram in

        comment 3, add a subsection that describes the role of
        perceptual representation learning in skill learning

        a.High-level, representation learning presents features for
        learning algorithms

        b.SimStudent specific

        i.Acquires and extends working memory hierarchy to replace

        manually constructed working memory (where), and feature
        extraction operator functions (how)

        parts are new./

        /- Another possible organizational strategy (besides big

        picture): Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and
        the human learning goals. (Does going for both improve the
        other?)/

        /- Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis
        -- grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)/

        1.Add a list of related work that’s more broadly relevant to

        the SimStudent project, rather than a specific component, and
        discuss how my work relates to other existing work

        a.Grammar learning (e.g., Stolcky’s thesis): Mostly focus on

        grammar induction, not applied to perceptual learning

        b.Perceptual learning (e.g., DBN): Stand alone module, models

        specific aspects of human learning (classification)

        c.Other representation learning mechanism: More focused on

        conceptual knowledge learning rather than perceptual learning,
        and most of them are not integrated in a learning agent

        d.Other cognitive architectures: We are the first that models

        perceptual learning, and integrate it into skill learning

        e.Student model: More focused on modeling student errors based

        on human student behavior, but has not matched the model with
        student learning curve data.

        and hypotheses that each experiment is addressing before

        Add a subsection in the experimental results section stating
        the hypothesis

        1.For Chapter 4, 5, 6, and 7, the hypothesis would be whether

        the SimStudent with representation learning can achieve
        comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original
        SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

        2.For Chapter 8, the hypothesis would be whether the extended
        SimStudent can be used to discover learnermodels than are
        better than human-generated models

        a.The additional subsection is to test how representation

        learning affects the quality of the learner model discovered
        by SimStudent

Nan,

For the figures, I suggest you have the "Human Author" box point to all four components and have these be the links that you cross out (except the last one).  That way you highlight you are reducing human effort.   You could probably just delete the "library of primitives" box and its links.

I'm ready to sign off otherwise.

Thanks,
Ken

Pat, I have to admit I'm getting a little frustrated with your silence on Nan's thesis.  Since the defense May 28, the calendar has been

June 4 - Nan send out a revision plan
June 12 - Nan sent out revisions
June 21 - Ken send Nan his final set of tweaks
June 26 - I sent you a reminder, asking for at least a schedule for when you would provide comments.

AFAIK, we haven't had a peep from you with any of these.  At this point, it's more than 1 month after the defense.  The other four members of the committee - me, Ken, Tom Mitchell, and Ray Mooney, all of whom have supervised many theses - have all signed off on the current version.  

Let me remind you that you explicitly asked to be on Nan's committee - obviously because you supported her and her work, wanted to be involved with it further, and had the time to do so.  If that's not the case, then we should have a phone meeting to discuss it; if it is, then you really need to respond.

Nan,

Thanks for your messages about the proposed / implemented changes
to your dissertation. The proposals all sound very reasonable, and
I will do my best to look through the new draft on Thursday, although
I may need a second day to finish reading it.

I apologize for the delayed response. I was distracted by a cold, a
urinary tract infection with complications, and another cold, the last
one at the same time as I was running an invited symposium, and
then I was preoccupied with a program review that involved a week's
travel and giving two talks.

That may help explain why I lost track of the time, although it's
not an excuse for not responding to email messages. I'm glad that
William called today to tell me about the urgency, and I do what I
can do give you a rapid response.

Best wishes, -Pat

Nan,

I have read through the revised version of your dissertation, and I
think it's a major improvement over the previous one. It's clear you
took many of the committee's suggestions to heart, the document as
a whole reads far better, and I appreciate all your efforts.

I have some minor comments that I'll send separately, but I will
focus here on five issues that I have raised before and that I do
not believe you have addressed sufficiently. None of them should
take long to remedy, but, together, they should make the thesis a
more scholarly piece of work:

1. For each subsystem you develop, discuss the design alternatives
    and the reasons you decided to follow the approach you did.
    This will help readers understand the space of solutions for
    the problem you have identified and the heuristics you used
    to make your choice about how to proceed.
2. For each subsystem you develop, discuss which aspects of your
    approach you consider psychologically plausible (in the sense
    that it is consistent with widely accepted theories of human
    cognition) and which are not. This will help readers tease
    apart your contributions to cognitive modeling from those to
    machine learning. [If you don't intend the methods in earlier
    chapters to be psychologically plausible, then you can state
    that explicitly and return to the topic in later chapters.]
3. In each chapter, discuss carefully how your approach relates to
    previous work in the area. You discussion sections all refer to
    related efforts, but they do not examine earlier systems in turn
    to examine their similarities to, and their differences from,
    your own approach. E.g., one sentence about Stolcke's work is
    not enough; you need at least a few sentences about it, and
    many others deserve the same treatment.
4. For each experiment, state explicitly the hypothesis you intend
    to test. The reader can usually infer it from the current text,
    but stating a clear hypothesis will ensure they understand your
    aims. Also state explicitly what independent variables you
    will alter to test this hypothesis. In closing, state clearly
    whether the results supported the hypothesis.
5. Discuss the limitations of your system and outline ideas for
    addressing them in future research. This will clarify the
    bounds on your contributions and identify open issues that
    can guide others interested in similar topics. One natural
    place for this material is in the final chapter.

<a name="doesnt-think"></a>
I am certain that I raised most of these issues in email I sent
before your defense, so I don't think they are new requests. I
believe you'll find similar comments on the hard-copy draft that
I gave you in Pittsburgh. I look forward to hearing whether you
think they are reasonable and achievable.

Again, I apologize for not responding sooner to your email. Please
feel free to call me (650-380-3350) any time if you would like to
discuss anything.

Best regards, -Pat

Pat,

These issues are too generic, do not appear responsive to the revision, and are not clearly mapped to the 6 items we agreed to and sent to Nan in the email.   You cannot ask her to be so careful if you cannot be so yourself.  For us to function fairly as a committee, you need to provide Nan with those mappings.   In addition, because you took so long to reply and because you did not explicitly comment on which of the 6 items she did or did not achieve, we must have these things immediately.   Can you provide the above by Monday?   If not, it will be best for all involved to move on.  You will be off the hook and William and I can proceed at our discretion as the rest of the (sufficient) committee allowed.

Thanks,
Ken

I'm a little confused, because Nan's already incorporated some of these revisions.  For instance, 


4. For each experiment, state explicitly the hypothesis you intend
    to test. 

But Nan's revision list  says

1.     (First paragraph of Section 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.2) For Chapter 4, 5, 6, and 7, the hypothesis would be whether the SimStudent with representation learning can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

and the thesis copy I have includes in section 4.3:

To further quantitatively evaluate the amount of required prior knowledge encoding and the learn- ing effectiveness of SimStudent, we carry out a controlled simulation study in three domains: fraction addition, equation solving, and stoichiometry. The objective of this experiment is to test whether the extended SimStudent can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

I agree that the new text is better along this dimension than the previous
version, but even here the hypothesis is hidden more than it needs to be.
I'm asking that Nan state the hypothesis first, in a separate sentence,
and then describe the experimental design she generated to test it. As
things stand, the hypotheses come out as afterthoughts rather than as
the motivation behind the studies.

I'm not sure what you mean about not being responsive to the revision.
I believe these are all things I asked Nan to address in my written
comments on the previous draft. My view is that her revision is not
responsive to my those requests. If she disagress with that position,
I'd be happy to hear her thoughts.

I understand now that I should have sent a critique of the six points
in your earlier message noting they were incomplete, but, again, I
assumed Nan would address the issues raised in my written comments
and not ignore them because they weren't on your list. I'm sure Nan
would be willing to show you my comments if you like.

If you think my requests are not operational, I can certainly be
more specific, but it will probably be more effective for Nan and
me to talk over the phone. I'm available for that this evening,
on Saturday, or on Sunday.

Best wishes, -Pat

Pat,

Yes, you should have replied to the 6 points earlier.  It is too late for that now.  Those are the points we requested and we are sticking with that.  No more.   Talking on the phone with Nan now is not sufficient.  If she is going to make any more changes, which I believe are not needed, you need to provide explicit change requests in writing and do so by end of day on Monday.  They need to be in the context of the 6 points (which were already overkill in my opinion) and in response to the changes Nan has made in response to those points.  See example below.

Your broader feedback is most welcome toward improving the work and future write ups.  But, the thesis need not to be (your image of) perfect.

Thanks,
Ken

I believe these are all things I asked Nan to address in my written

responsive to my those requests.
In what ways?  Say something like: On p. XX you response to item XX is not quite sufficient because XX.

Also - I'd like to discourage you talking to Nan directly, Pat - Ken
and I are obviously stakeholders here also, and we may have different
preferences regarding the shape of the thesis (eg, I actually think
it's a awkward stylistically to have paragraphs like: "Hypothesis: the
extended SimStudent can achieve comparable or better learning
effectiveness than the original SimStudent...", as you seem to be
suggesting.)  We don't want to be giving Nan contradictory advice, as
a committee.  That's why it's important to stick to the fixed list of
revisions that we gave her before.

I don't believe I ever agreed to limit myself to the six points you
sent earlier. I agree that I should have told you that I had additional
concerns, but I'm certain that Nan knew that from explicit requests
I made on the hard copy I gave her during my visit, as well as in
email messages. I'm not sure why you think it's appropriate for her
to ignore those requests.

I'm sorry that we have such different views about what constitures an
acceptable dissertation. Do you want to accept a thesis that doesn't
discuss related work carefully or that doesn't discuss limitations
of the approach? I'm nearly certain I asked Nan to address these in
my written comments. If you think they're not important, then you're
welcome to take that position, but I doubt that many CMU faculty
would agree with you.

> Say something like: On p. XX you response to item XX is not quite
> sufficient because XX.

I can provide more specific requests in this format before Monday,
but they'll focus on the high-level points I raised. I look forward
to hearing whether Nan wants this feedback from me. I understand
that you want to protect her from unreasonable requests, but I
think we should see whether she views them as unreasonable.

Best wishes, -Pat

P.S. I agree that my fourth point about hypotheses is debatable,
        but it's also the easiest to address. If Nan thinks that
        change is unnecessary, I won't insist on it.

I think it is appropriate to 100% appropriate to not respond to (let's
not say "ignore") those requests.  Pat, if you recall the timeline
was:

May 28 - defense
June 4 - Nan send out a revision plan -- no comments from you
June 12 - Nan sent out revisions -- no comments from you
June 26 - I sent you a reminder, asking for at least a schedule for
when you would provide comments.
Jul 1 - I sent another reminder
Jul 3 - I called you
Jul 5 - you responded with comments.

If I understand Nan's visa situation, she is basically barred from
making any income until she finishes her thesis, so delays are a real
hardship.  More generally, as a committee one of our priorities is to
give feedback in a timely way.  If Nan sent out a detailed plan for
revisions a full month ago, and you did NOT respond in a timely way,
but instead let her take weeks revising and waiting for your response,
and only THEN do you ask for additional changes, this isn't being
responsive - or responsible.

More generally, the committee approval process, as I understand it, is
NOT that all comments made by every committee member are addressed -
in general that's impossible, since requests can be contradictory.
Instead the committee meets, collectively decides on a limited list of
sufficient revisions which are immediately communicated to the
candidate and the rest of the committee.  That's what we did.  Do you
understand the process to be different?

Empirically, Pat, Ken's not the outlier here - everyone else on the
committee (and Tom, Ray and I have done a lot of thesis committees!)
has signed off already.  I don't think our ideas about what's a
reasonable thesis are unusual.

Again, I'd like to remind you that you asked to be on the committee -
and I'm assuming you knew more or less what was going to be in the
thesis, and what Ken and I consider acceptable, since Nan's been
publishing steadily.  What was the motivation? I'm assuming your goal
was to be involved in work you liked and respected, not to save
science from the flood of substandard students that Ken and I are
about to unleash on the world.

Again, it's not just protecting Nan - it's ensuring that the final
thesis, and the process that we use to get to it, satisfies our
standards of what's good science and responsible mentoring.  In short
there's another issue at stake here, which is whether Ken and I think
the revisions are unreasonable and/or appropriate.  Also, if there are
extensive changes in response to your feedback, then the other
committee members would be responsible for re-reading the revised
thesis.  Is it fair to ask them to do that?

William,

I'm sorry to hear that. I agree that timely responses are important
and I have already both apologized and explained that I had three
weeks of illness (including a bout of epididymitis, which you are
welcome to look up), a local symposium, and another week of travel.
But I think we should move beyond that and focus on the thesis.

We agreed on some major issues that Nan was supposed to address.
I do not think Ken's written list included everything we agreed on
in person, and I certainly did not think it meant that Nan would not
incorporate requests I made in my hard-copy comments without
even discussing them with me.

I understand that committee members may disagree, and I think your
point about how one states hypotheses is a reasonable example.
But I don't think a request to discuss related work carefully (I suggest
you look at her treatment of Stolcke's thesis, which we DID discuss
at the defense) or to talk about limitations and future work are
unreasonable. I feel strongly that both should be part of any
dissertation, and I don't really believe that you and Ken disagree.

We could have a long discussion about this topic, and perhaps we
should, but I don't think it's relevant to the situation at hand.

If Nan makes changes that are purely additions or elaborations, I
doubt that others on the committee will feel like they must read the
new version. If you feel otherwise, then you can send them the
new material, which should not be long.

In an effort to be constructive, and taking into account the urgency
you mentioned, I'll send another note soon that suggests some steps
that Nan might practically implement in a short time. I look forward
to hearing what you, Ken, and Nan think of my requests.

Best wishes, -Pat

William and Ken,

I should mention that I recently sent Nan detailed but mostly minor
comments on her latest draft. I explained that I viewed all of the
proposed changes as optional, but I should also note that I found
a number of ungrammatical constructions (the opening of one chapter
was a run on), technical inaccuracies about related research, and
statements about her work that I felt were misleading. Incoporating
these will be her call, although I hope she will fix the more glaring
problems. Again, I'll send thoughts about my high-level concerns in
a separate message.

Best wishes, -Pat

Nan,

In response to Ken's suggestion, I'm writing with more detailed requests
for changes to your dissertation. I don't think these change the scope
of the thesis, and I hope you will be able to implement them without
too much time and effort. These are all similar to the points I raised
before, but I have repackaged them in ways that I hope will make them
more tractable.

I suggest that we limit new material to a few places, and that we keep
those as brief as possible:

1. In the discussion sections at the end of Chapters 3 through 8:

   a. Add one paragraph that clarifies which aspects of your approach
      or system you claim are psychologically plausible [in the sense
      they are consistent with generally accepted views about human
      cognition], which you do not view in that light, and any ideas
      you have about making the latter more consistent with established
      views [although the last item could be reserved for material on
      future work in the final chapter.] I'm guessing that six or so
      sentences would suffice in each case.

   b. Discuss alternative approaches that you might have used in
      your approach/system, and the reasons you selected the approach
      you did. This should cover issues like the representation of
      learned knowledge (e.g., grammar vs. discrimination network,
      symbolic vs. probabilistic), operators for taking steps through
      the space of candidates, and heuristics for guiding search. I
      see two ways you might organize these comments. One would
      be a separate paragraph with two or three sentences for each
      issue. Another would combine this when discussing how related
      work has adopted different approaches to the same problem.

   c. Discuss carefully how your approach relates to the most closely
      related work on the topic. For each comparison, note ways in
      which the two are similar, ways in which they differ, and the
      contribution your work makes. Since it's unrealistic to provide
      such a comparison for all cited systems, I suggest you take the
      most similar system in each chapter. E.g., Stolcke's scheme for
      for inducing context-free grammars by model merging is VERY
      similar to your own. Combined with your existing text, this would
      make your discussion sections much stronger. [I think your
      treatment of EPAM is already reasonable.]

2. At the end of Chapter 9, discuss the limitations of your system
   and outline ideas for addressing them in future research. Here
   are three points that you might discuss: (a) the nonincremental
   character of your learning methods and ideas for developing
   incremental variants; (b) the mongrel character of your various
   learning mechanisms and ways you might recast SimStudent
   in a unified theory of the cognitive architecture; and (c) the
   parametric character of your individual learner models and
   ways you might use SimStudent more directly to infer student
   knowledge states in the context of a tutoring system.

   I am not requesting that you specifically address these points,
   although I view all as limitations of the current framework.
   But I do care that you acknowledge explicitly that you work
   has drawbacks and that you have ideas about how to remedy
   them. I think you could do a reasonable job of this in just three
   paragraphs at the end of the chapter, then wrap up with a
   closing few sentences. [I see now that you discuss the idea
   of a more unified approach on page 86, but it's hidden amidst
   other text, rather than being discussed with other limitations.]

I hope that you find these suggestions both concrete and reasonable.
I believe they are similar to changes I requested in my hard-copy
comments, but repackaged to make them tractable in the short
time that's available. If you (or Ken or William) think these requests
are not specific enough, I can add detail, but my purpose is not
to tell you exactly what points to make, only to ask that you talk
about issues of psychological plausibility, design alternatives,
differences from prior work, and limitations.

Can you please let me know if you feel that making additions along
these lines would be both reasonable and doable in the time that
remains? Again, I don't think I'm asking for anything that I did not
request in my earlier written comments.

Best regards, -Pat

Nan,

I just reread my latest note and I realize that I'm asking you to add
three paragraphs per system chapter, plus another three at the
end, which is quite a bit.

If you prefer, you might simply declare in Chapter 1 that you will
delay discussion of psychological plausibility until later in the thesis,
then address it at slightly more length, say two paragraphs, in the
conclusion.

Also, as I mentioned, you might save writing by combining your
discussion of design alternatives with your review of related work.
The important thing is that you acknowledge other approaches are
possible and that you give reasons for the choices you made.

Best, -Pat

Ken and William,

In reviewing the additions I just requested from Nan, I thought
back over the items we discussed after her defense. I'm certain
that I raised most of the same points there, including the need to
discuss design alternatives, to distinguish psychological claims
about the system from others, and the need to distinguish her
work from previous efforts, especially approaches like that in
Stolcke's thesis.

I don't recall any objections to these points from others on the
committee. If they did not make it into the list that Ken sent
out, then I think he was remiss in omitting them, but then I also
dropped the ball by failing to note their absence, as well as by
not responding to email more generally over the past few weeks.

However, I believe strongly that I'm not asking for anything
that I did not raise in the meeting, except possibly my request
for a few paragraphs on limitations and future work, which I'm
almost certain I mentioned in my hard-copy comments, and which
I'm guessing is the least controversial issue anyway.

Best wishes, -Pat

Pat,

As I requested (and you ignored), please relate any request you have to 1 or more of the 6 points and, in this regard, be sure to make clear that you have read Nan's attempts to address these points by indicating where those attempts fall short in your opinion.  Your current comments are too generic.   If you do not do this, we will not require Nan to address your comments.   You are right that I attempted to incorporate your concerns in the 6 points.  If I did not do so successfully, it is your fault for not having noted that right away or at least after our repeated requests.   As I said before, we need this by Monday (tomorrow) at the latest.  My strong preference is you just drop it or, at most, find 1 or 2 points you feel particularly strongly about.

More below.

Ken

P.S. I am quite tired of wasting time repeating myself and arguing with you, Pat.

Spending any more time arguing about "psychological plausibility" without data is not worth the effort at this point.

       your approach/system, and the reasons you selected the approach
       you did.
Nan has done this.  She cannot address all alternatives.  Again, if there are specific points,


This should cover issues like the representation of
       learned knowledge (e.g., grammar vs. discrimination network,
       symbolic vs. probabilistic), operators for taking steps through

    c. Discuss carefully how your approach relates to the most closely
       related work on the topic.
Again, she has attempted to do this, so asking again is insufficient.  Say specifically what is wrong with what has been done referencing specific page numbers.

For each comparison, note ways in
       which the two are similar, ways in which they differ, and the
       contribution your work makes. Since it's unrealistic to provide

       most similar system in each chapter. E.g., Stolcke's scheme for
       for inducing context-free grammars by model merging is VERY
       similar to your own.
The only well-justified request I have seen so far is that you want a bit more about Stolcke.  That seems fine.

  Combined with your existing text, this would
       make your discussion sections much stronger. [I think your
       treatment of EPAM is already reasonable.]

2. At the end of Chapter 9, discuss the limitations of your system

    ways you might use SimStudent more directly to infer student
    knowledge states in the context of a tutoring system.

I don't agree that I need to limit my requests to the six points in your
May 20 message, since I never agreed that would be adequate. I
have already apologized for not telling you this sooner, but that
does not obligate me to buy into their sufficiency. However, I have
looked at the list again, and I'll send a separate note about how
my recent requests relate to them.

> Your current comments are too generic.

Looking at your embedded responses to my points, I think I see
what you'd like me to provide. I believe I already did give Nan highly
specific requests in my hard-copy comments, of which I do not
have a copy because I trusted her to treat them seriously. But I'll try
to generate even more specific suggestions in another message.

> If you do not do this, we will not require Nan to address your

I don't really think that's your choice. I'll need to be satisfied with the
final version to sign off. Perhaps you've already looked into how to
remove me from the committee against my wishes, but I think that
would look bad for all involved, especially when many of our problems
seem due to miscommunication and when the content of my requests
(e.g., to discuss related work carefully and acknowledge limitations)
are reasonable ones.

I'm happy to share the responsibility, but I think you should, too. We
both knew that we had a history of disagreement, so you should not
have assumed I agreed with your summary.

I have already given constructive feedback, but I'll try to send even
more soon. I have not mentioned anything that I do not feel strongly
about, except for some of the detailed comments I sent Nan separately.
I do hope you want her to correct technical and syntactical errors.

> I am quite tired of wasting time repeating myself and arguing with you.

This has been draining on me, too. But when reasonable people disagree,
they discuss things and try to reach a compromise. I've already changed
my requests substantially in response to concerns you and William
have raised. It would be nice if you would act less autocratically and
acknowledge that I have some rights in this situation, too.

Nan,

I'm writing to clarify how my recent requests relate to some of the
items listed in his May 20 message. The purpose is to establish that
they are not new requests and that they relate to what Ken claims
the committee agreed upon at the defense. I will send a follow-up note
with more specific requests about how I would like you to address each
of these points.

> 2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in
>     skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

I view this point as related to my request that you discuss design
alternatives for the problems you address in various chapters. This
is also a point I  raised in email before your defense and, I believe,
in the hard-copy comments I left with you in Pittsbugrgh.

> 4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at
>     the end

This point is directly related to my request that you discuss related
research in more detail, although I do not recall agreeing that this
would be best done in the final chapter.

> Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps
> walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas
> already existed (with references) and which parts are new.

I don't recall expressing concern myself (others may have) about having
an integrated treatment of related work. My concern is that your text
on earlier efforts is shallow and unscholarly, in that it (typically) lists
previous systems but does not compare and contrast them with your
own approach.

> Distinguish between the knowledge engineering and the human learning
> goals. (Does going for both improve the other?)

I view this point as a variant on my request that you discuss which
aspects of your system are psychologically plausible. Since Ken objects
to that phrasing, I'll restate my request to ask that you distinguish
clearly between those aspects of your work that you view as making
psychological claims and those which do not.

> Get a more complete set of references (e.g., Stolcky thesis --
> grammar learning -- see Pat's suggestions)

This is a garbled version of my request. Again, I was asking that you
discuss the similarities to, and differences from, closely related
systems. Stolcke's thesis work is an extreme example, since I see
the grammar induction system in Chapter 3 as a minor variation on it.

> 5) Chapters in thesis read like conference papers -- subproblems
>     solved -- more unified description.

I do not believe you have done a very good job of addressing this
request. The chapters are still uneven, with some reading very much
like conference papers, and one even still mentioning the word "paper".
But I don't think it's realistic to ask you to do more on this front
at this point. I mention it only to express my disappointment and
to clarify why I'm standing my ground on other requests.

> 6) Motivate and make more clear what the research questions and
>     hypotheses that each experiment is addressing before presenting
>     experimental results

This relates to one of the initial requests I sent a few days ago. I
agree now with William that the phrasing I suggested earlier is not
required, I do think you should include more than the one or two
sentences you currently have. However, I'll let you decide whether
to revise the text; again, I'm pointing this out because I think you
could have done a much better job.

I believe this covers all of my requests except the one related to
limitations and future work. I still believe it's essential that you
include material about those, unless you have already discussed
them and I somehow missed it.

Best wishes, -Pat

Nan,

Following Ken's request, I'm enclosing specific suggestions about
changes that I would like you to make to your dissertation. I have
done my best to package these in a way that you can address rapidly,
and I hope you feel they are manageable. Naturally, I also hope you
will go through the detailed comments I sent separately, but these
are the only changes that I consider truly essential.

- Section 3.3. Please add to this section:

 (1) A brief paragraph (three or four sentences) about which aspects
      of your system you view as making theoretical claims about human
      cognition and which you do not. E.g., you might state a commitment
      to your representation (with or without the probabilities) but not
      to the performance and learning mechanisms.

 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and differs
      from, Stolcke's system in terms of representation, operators for
      generating candidate grammars, search organization, and evaluation
      function for guiding that search. Acknowledge that, except for
      the "feature learning" mechanism, your approach is nearly identical
      to Stolcke's system, and remove claims that his work (and similar
      work by others) does not address representation learning.

 (3) A few sentences that explain why you chose to approach perceptual
      learning in terms of context-free grammars rather than using
      discrimination nets or connectionist models, both of which have
      a longer history in cognitive psychology. Alternatively, you can
      discuss this at the end of (1) or even in a few sentences at the
      end of the EPAM paragraph.

- Section 4.4. Please add to this section:

 (1) A brief paragraph (three or four sentences) about which aspects
      of your system you view as making theoretical claims about human
      cognition and which you do not. E.g., your key claim might be
      that parsing based on a perceptual grammar determines how the
      learner explains observed steps in a problem solution, but not
      the details of how this takes place.

 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and how
      it differs from, either Neves' early approach to learning in
      algebra or, preferably, its relation to Jones and VanLehn's
      Cascade model, which filled in gaps in worked-out solutions
      to physics problems.

 Since this section is already reasonably long, I won't ask you to
 discuss design alternatives. Some variant on explanation-based
 learning seems like the obvious approach.

Section 5.5. Please add to this section:

 (1) A paragraph about which aspects of your system you view as making
      theoretical claims about human cognition and which you do not.
      Presumably this will be similar to the statement for Chapter 3,
      with the additional statement that perceptual grammars involve
      two dimensions, as do the resulting parse trees. Include a few
      sentences that explain why you chose to approach perceptual
      learning in terms of grammars rather than, say, discrimination
      networks or even multi-layer connectionist models. This can repeat
      the arguments from Chapter 3.

 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and how
      it differs from, some other system that learns pCFGs for either
      displays or images. The current text suggests (but does not state
      explicitly) that noone else has developed a system that learns
      2D grammatical structures, but the paper

     Zu, L., Chen, Y., & Yuille, A. (2009). Unsupervised learning of
        probabilistic grammar-Markov models for object categories. IEEE
        Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31.
        http://people.csail.mit.edu/leozhu/paper/TPAMI-2007-03-0146-2.pdf

      appears to address the same issue pretty directly. I'm not sure why
      Ray Mooney didn't point you to this work. I don't care in particular
      about this paper, but I think you should devote at least a few
      sentences to comparing you approach to one similar system.

Section 6.4. Please add to this section:

 (1) A brief paragraph about whether you are making any psychological
      claims about this module (I'm guessing these are minimal), as
      well as what alternatives you considered in addressing the task.
      In particular, I'd like to hear why you decided that methods for
      defining new predicates from the ILP community were not enough
      for your needs, especially since some of them (especially those
      involving inverse resolution) involve introducing nonterminals
      in simple grammars.

 (2) A paragraph that discusses two efforts that focused on revising
      or extending representation in the context of problem solving:
      Utgoff's thesis work and our joint work on learning predicates
      for use in Icarus skills. Explain how your approach is similar,
      how it differs, and why you needed new mechanisms.

  Also, please rewrite the sentence "...there has been considerable
  work on representation change...little has occurred in the context
  of representation learning", which does not make sense to me. If
  you think these two tasks are distinct, you should explain that
  difference here and, hopefully, much earlier.

Section 7.5. This section seems so weak that I'm not sure what
  revisions to request. You cite only one paper on article selection
  and that appears to report an empirical study. Since the chapter
  is ostensibly about representation learning in the context of
  background knowledge, I would have expected you to discuss at
  least some work on the latter topic. The work you cover seems
  marginally related and reads like filler. I don't honestly think
  you can salvage this section without a complete rewrite, which
  I don't feel is reasonable to request at this point, but I think
  it's important that you understand how the text falls short.

Section 8.8. Please correct the problems I mentioned in the detailed
  comments I sent yesterday. These include:

  (1) Reorder your text about Debuggy, LMS, ACM (Langley/Ohlsson),
       and Baffes/Mooney to reflect the dates they were published,
       since earlier efforts influenced later ones. Also, describe
       the Langley/Ohlsson work as using machine learning but not the
       Conati/VanLehn work. Also, I would be very happy to see you
       add a paragraph that discusses how your approach differs from,
       and is similar to, Conati's work, but I won't insist on it.

  (2) In the third paragraph, revise the third sentence to state
       something like "Although these did not focus on modeling
       how representation change affects skill learning, work by
       Utgoff (1984) and by Li et al. (2012) has done so." Then
       add one sentence on each system that notes its contribution
       to this topic. [To be honest, I don't know why you have
       this paragraph here, since it's only marginally relevant
       to the chapter, but, if you're going to include it, it should
       be technically accurate.]

Chapter 9. Please add, at the end of this chapter, a few paragraphs
      that discuss limitations of your framework and some ideas on
      how to address them in future research. I see now that you
      mention one or two limitations in earlier chapters, but you
      were not consistent about that, and I think the material makes
      more sense here. This request did not appear in the list that
      Ken compiled, but the thesis will be incomplete without it.

My counting suggests that, depending on how you package things,
these changes will require only 11 new paragraphs and minor changes
to a few existing ones. If you would prefer to discuss psychological
claims in the final chapter, rather than in each of the content chapters,
that would reduce things further and would be fine with me, provided
you note that you'll be delaying discussion of this issue somewhere
in the first chapter.

Best wishes, -Pat

Ken,

I thought that sending detailed requests to Nan was more urgent than
responding to your in-line comments, but I'm doing that here to make
sure to clarify a few things.

>> a. Add one paragraph that clarifies which aspects of your approach
>>     or system you claim are psychologically plausible...

> Spending any more time arguing about "psychological plausibility"
> without data is not worth the effort at this point.

I have rephrased this request to remove issues of plausibility and
focus on which aspects of the work Nan considers to be a contribution
to psychological theory and which to machine learning without any
claims about the former. I hope you don't object to that.

>> b. Discuss alternative approaches that you might have used in your
>>     approach/system, and the reasons you selected the approach
>>     you did.

> Nan has done this. She cannot address all alternatives. Again, if there
> are specific points,

I have looked for examples of such discussions and I have not found
them. If you can point out one or two cases, then I can either explain
why I don't find them satisfactory or withdraw my request.

>> c. Discuss carefully how your approach relates to the most closely
>>     related work on the topic.

> Again, she has attempted to do this, so asking again is insufficient.

> specific page numbers.

I hope you find my recent message to be specific enough on this front.
I don't believe it's appropriate for me to analyze the similarities and
differences for Nan.

>> 2. At the end of Chapter 9, discuss the limitations of your system
>>     and outline ideas for addressing them in future research.

> She has done the above as you indicate below. Yet another example of

> has been acheived.

I'm guessing you're referring here to one of my specific ideas about
topics she might discuss, rather than about the idea of considering
limitations more generally. If Nan has done that elsewhere in the
thesis, then please point it out to me. If so, then I might be satisfied
with one paragraph that summarizes them here, but I don't think
she has devoted much text to the issue.

> Sorry, but this is a nit at this point.

Again, I'm guessing this is about a specific suggetion I made and
not about discussing limitations and future work more generally.

Regards, -Pat

Just to comment on one point here, where you said:

FYI I had a general conversation with a colleague a while ago about my
recent/upcoming defenses this spring and summer - I'll use a male
personal pronoun here for convenience - before this whole revision
thing came up, while I'd been waiting for your comments.  Somewhat to
my surprise, he knew that you'd worked with Nan before, and that you'd
asked to be on the committee.  After hearing you were the holdout in
approving the thesis, he immediately assumed that you'd gotten
yourself on the committee to make things difficult in order to "get
back" at Nan for switching schools and advisors.

I did what I could to correct that assumption, but the word "all" is
appropriate here - we should conclude this in a way that reinforces
our own reputations for consistently behaving responsibly, but also
reasonably, and (obviously) ethically.  Clearly I'm not saying
anything you don't know here, Pat - just a word to the wise, as they
say.

I appreciate you letting me know about the mistaken inference. If he
had known anything about the history (e.g., my encouraging Nan to
move to CMU to improve her chances to get a faculty position), I
hope he would have concluded otherwise.

And I appreciate you trying to correct his misinterpretation. Many
people over the years have (and still do) misunderstand my reasons
for doing things. They also seldom understand how much I have
compromised my principles because they are often so much at
odds with others' positions on things I care about.

I'm also very glad you called me when you did, since I had lost track
of how much time had passed and I really had intended to give
rapid feedback. And I appreciate you taking a more gentle approach
than Ken in dealing with the current situation, although I know you
agree with him on the main points.

Nan,

I thought it worth clarifying the kind of paragraph I'm hoping to see
when you compare your work in detail to an earlier effort. When
discussing similarities and differences, I think natural candidates
include representation of learned knowledge, performance processes,
and learning mechanisms, with the latter being most important.

If the system carries out search through a space of structures,
then you might compare and contrast the operators for generating
structures, the search-control scheme used to explore the space,
and the evaluation method used to guide it. I suggested something
along these lines for discussion of Stolcke's thesis work.

Thes aren't the only types of comments you might make about links
to a predecessor system, but I wanted to make sure you have at
least one way of organizing your discussions.

By the way, I think I figured out why I wasn't opening the occasional
email messages I saw arriving from Nan, you, and Ken, apart from
being sick and preoccupied with the symposium and such. I think,
unconsciously, I was worried that the revised thesis would still have
the kinds of (to my mind) serious problems that it does, and I just
wasn't ready to face it, especially since I knew that would lead to
arguments with Ken. That's not an excuse, and I don't think it will
help to share the insight with Ken or Nan, but I thought it might help
you understand better how we came to this pass.

Do you think I have I provided Nan with sufficiently detailed requests
for changes to her latest draft? I know that I've asked for more than
you want, but I also think it's something she can handle in one or two
days, and I have been asking for changes along these lines for some
time. By the way, I think you were right in asking me to be specific. I
believe Nan has been trying to address my concerns all along but has
not really understood what I wanted.

In case you didnt get my text, I talked with Nan and she is ok with removing Pat.

At the same time, perhaps it is reasonable for Nan to take a pass at addressing a few (1-3?) of Pat's requests ... Maybe we can give her some guidance on which ones ...

Ken,

I appreciate that you took the time to call this morning about Nan's
thesis, even though we did not seem to come any closer to reaching
common ground about how to proceed.

However, you asked an important question about why I'm insisting
on the changes I specified. You suggested that my reason was not
to help Nan, which I defended at first but then dropped. That was
one of my original aims for wanting to serve on her committee, but
I agree that it's not behind my current position.

Briefly, my reason for insisting on the additions I have listed is that
I believe any CMU dissertation should meet certain basic standards
of academic quality. I don't think Nan's current draft meets such
standards, and I believe the changes I have enumerated are the
bare minimum required to meet them.

I realize that you and the rest of the committee do not feel the
same way about the thesis, but that's irrelevant to my judgement.
I think the document is very weak along the dimensions I have
described, and I'm already stretching my comfort level by saying
I will accept a revision with only the changes I've specified.

Any version of the dissertation that does not incorporate these
revisions would fall below my minimum level of acceptable academic
quality, and I feel that signing off on it would be unethical. I'm
sorry that we have such different standards for theses, but I can't
believe that you, other members of the committee, or the University
would want me to accept a document I find seriously lacking.

Hi Nan,

Here's some feedback.

Change:
"rather than applying the techniques to representation learning and integrating it with skill learning as we do here."
to something like
"rather than applying the techniques to learn a representation that is the basis for subsequent skill learning as we do here."

The change on 8.8 seems fine.

Do you have time to make more changes?  We are still gathering information, but it seems like the process of removing Pat from the committee may be more complicated than I thought ...      Thus, making as many changes as you can is in the best interest of getting this done.

Feel free to call if you have questions.

Ken and William,

I recall that I signed something after Nan's defense that may be what
she needs to turn in as evidence that her committee has approved
her dissertation.

I'm writing to clarify that, regardless of that signature, I will not
consider her dissertation acceptable until she has incororated the
changes I requested in my July 7 message.

I look forward to seeing the new material, which should not take long
to incorporate, at which point I'll be pleased to approve the thesis.
Naturally, I'll be happy to answer any questions that Nan has about
the content I have asked her to add.

Regards, -Pat

P.S. to Nan: I thought about sending this note directly to you, but
        I'm confident that Ken and William have been advising you
        on how to proceed, so they seem more natural recipients.

Thanks for the clarification. Ken has suggested a number of times
that the changes I have specified should not, or will not, happen,
and I wasn't sure what mechanism he had in mind for enforcing
that position.

I'm not sure what would be involved in removing me from Nan's
committee against my wishes, but I'm guessing that it would slow
things down, and produce more fallout, than for Nan to implement
the changes I have indicated.

If you decide to follow that route, I hope you will tell me who you
have contacted about the issue so I have a chance to tell them
my side of the story.

Here's the whole thread, I think.

Ken and I are both travelling, but if you want more of the backstory, it would probably be easiest to describe the nuances of this situation over the phone - my cell is 412 901 4879, and I'm on the west coast, we could probably find a time.  

Nan's case is quite unusual in that she had five committee members, instead of the required four - in part because Ken and I weren't sure of what Pat would end up doing, and anticipated the possibility of trouble. Obviously, we should have checked with you first about this plan.

Hi Pat,

I have made changes to my thesis according to the plan. I am attaching the updated thesis as well as the plan, which points to the sections where I have made changes.

1) Compare using AFM to original SimStudent.

(Section 8.6) Will add a subsection in Chapter 8 to compare the original SimStudent with the new SimStudent in algebra domain.

 

2) Add a clear discussion of the role of perceptual rep learning in skill learning and how this effects the choices in SimStudent

1.     (The end of page 4) In Chapter 1, clearly state that "One of the distinctive elements of SimStudent and my extensions to it is the emphasis on perceptual information retrieval (a separate part of production rule if-parts described in section X.X) and perceptual learning (where and what learning described in section X.X).  This emphasis is important because ... [refs to perceptual chunking, Chi].  It is different from other cognitive architectures as most of the existing cognitive architectures do not distinguish perceptual knowledge from conceptual knowledge. Icarus does have a perceptual memory and a conceptual knowledge base, but it focuses more on concept knowledge learning [refs to Li’s master work], and does not model perceptual learning.”

2.     (Section 2.3) In Chapter 2, add a subsection that describes SimStudent’s performance system

a.     How working memory is organized as a hierarchy

b.    How production rules are matched with the working memory as well as feature tests

c.     Differentiate the two different parts of the if-parts

3.     (First paragraph of Chapter 3) In Chapter 3, make it clear that the representation learning algorithm mentioned here is a stand-alone module that is not yet integrated into SimStudent

4.     (First paragraph of page 4) In Chapter 1, after adding the “big picture” diagram in comment 3, add a subsection that describes the role of perceptual representation learning in skill learning

a.     High-level, representation learning presents features for learning algorithms

b.    SimStudent specific

                                               i.     Acquires and extends working memory hierarchy to replace manually constructed working memory (where), and feature extraction operator functions (how)

                                              ii.     Automatically generates feature predicates for when learning

 

3) Add a "big picture" diagram in intro

Have visualization of the relationships between the parts of the thesis, parts of SimStudent learning, parts of performance representation (production system).    Make a "big picture" and a subsection describing it.   Put perhaps at end of chapter 1 (or after SimStudent description)

 

Clarify the 3 different kinds of models/systems and how they are related.  What feeds into what and which parts are done and which are planned.

 

Clarify  how the (various components of the) performance system use the learned results of the various learning mechanisms

1.     (Figure 1.3, Section 1.2.2) One big picture diagram that relates, SimStudent, Cognitive Model, Model Tracing + Knowledge Tracing in cognitive tutors

2.     (Figure 1.1, 2.5, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6.1, 6.2) One more focused diagram on SimStudent that relates, where, when, and how learning with perceptual representation learning

3.     (Figure 1.2) One more focused diagram on cognitive tutors

 

4) Provide a more complete and integrated related work section at the end

Make a more uniform and integrated related work section -- perhaps walk through the big picture diagram and indicate which parts/ideas already existed (with references) and which parts are new.

Pat,

We would like to sign off on Nan's revisions by the end of the week.  Can you have comments for her in the next day or two?


I have reviewed these changes and given Nan some comments on refinements, but it looks in range for completion.

Thanks,
Ken

Nan,

For the figures, I suggest you have the "Human Author" box point to all four components and have these be the links that you cross out (except the last one).  That way you highlight you are reducing human effort.   You could probably just delete the "library of primitives" box and its links.

I'm ready to sign off otherwise.

Thanks,
Ken

Pat, I have to admit I'm getting a little frustrated with your silence on Nan's thesis.  Since the defense May 28, the calendar has been

June 4 - Nan send out a revision plan
June 12 - Nan sent out revisions
June 21 - Ken send Nan his final set of tweaks
June 26 - I sent you a reminder, asking for at least a schedule for when you would provide comments.

AFAIK, we haven't had a peep from you with any of these.  At this point, it's more than 1 month after the defense.  The other four members of the committee - me, Ken, Tom Mitchell, and Ray Mooney, all of whom have supervised many theses - have all signed off on the current version.  

Let me remind you that you explicitly asked to be on Nan's committee - obviously because you supported her and her work, wanted to be involved with it further, and had the time to do so.  If that's not the case, then we should have a phone meeting to discuss it; if it is, then you really need to respond.

- W

Pat,

These issues are too generic, do not appear responsive to the revision, and are not clearly mapped to the 6 items we agreed to and sent to Nan in the email.   You cannot ask her to be so careful if you cannot be so yourself.  For us to function fairly as a committee, you need to provide Nan with those mappings.   In addition, because you took so long to reply and because you did not explicitly comment on which of the 6 items she did or did not achieve, we must have these things immediately.   Can you provide the above by Monday?   If not, it will be best for all involved to move on.  You will be off the hook and William and I can proceed at our discretion as the rest of the (sufficient) committee allowed.

Thanks,
Ken

I'm a little confused, because Nan's already incorporated some of these revisions.  For instance, 


4. For each experiment, state explicitly the hypothesis you intend
    to test. 

But Nan's revision list  says

1.     (First paragraph of Section 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.2) For Chapter 4, 5, 6, and 7, the hypothesis would be whether the SimStudent with representation learning can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

and the thesis copy I have includes in section 4.3:

To further quantitatively evaluate the amount of required prior knowledge encoding and the learn- ing effectiveness of SimStudent, we carry out a controlled simulation study in three domains: fraction addition, equation solving, and stoichiometry. The objective of this experiment is to test whether the extended SimStudent can achieve comparable or better learning effectiveness than the original SimStudent, but with much smaller knowledge engineering effort.

I agree that the new text is better along this dimension than the previous
version, but even here the hypothesis is hidden more than it needs to be.
I'm asking that Nan state the hypothesis first, in a separate sentence,
and then describe the experimental design she generated to test it. As
things stand, the hypotheses come out as afterthoughts rather than as
the motivation behind the studies.

I'm not sure what you mean about not being responsive to the revision.
I believe these are all things I asked Nan to address in my written
comments on the previous draft. My view is that her revision is not
responsive to my those requests. If she disagress with that position,

I'd be happy to hear her thoughts.

I understand now that I should have sent a critique of the six points
in your earlier message noting they were incomplete, but, again, I
assumed Nan would address the issues raised in my written comments
and not ignore them because they weren't on your list. I'm sure Nan
would be willing to show you my comments if you like.

If you think my requests are not operational, I can certainly be
more specific, but it will probably be more effective for Nan and
me to talk over the phone. I'm available for that this evening,
on Saturday, or on Sunday.

Best wishes, -Pat

Pat,

Yes, you should have replied to the 6 points earlier.  It is too late for that now.  Those are the points we requested and we are sticking with that.  No more.   Talking on the phone with Nan now is not sufficient.  If she is going to make any more changes, which I believe are not needed, you need to provide explicit change requests in writing and do so by end of day on Monday.  They need to be in the context of the 6 points (which were already overkill in my opinion) and in response to the changes Nan has made in response to those points.  See example below.

Your broader feedback is most welcome toward improving the work and future write ups.  But, the thesis need not to be (your image of) perfect.

Thanks,
Ken

These issues are too generic, do not appear responsive to the

sent to Nan in the email. You cannot ask her to be so careful if you
cannot be so yourself. For us to function fairly as a committee,
you need to provide Nan with those mappings.
I'm not sure what you mean about not being responsive to the revision.
I believe these are all things I asked Nan to address in my written
comments on the previous draft. My view is that her revision is not
responsive to my those requests.
In what ways?  Say something like: On p. XX you response to item XX is not quite sufficient because XX.

Also - I'd like to discourage you talking to Nan directly, Pat - Ken
and I are obviously stakeholders here also, and we may have different
preferences regarding the shape of the thesis (eg, I actually think
it's a awkward stylistically to have paragraphs like: "Hypothesis: the
extended SimStudent can achieve comparable or better learning
effectiveness than the original SimStudent...", as you seem to be
suggesting.)  We don't want to be giving Nan contradictory advice, as
a committee.  That's why it's important to stick to the fixed list of
revisions that we gave her before.

I don't believe I ever agreed to limit myself to the six points you
sent earlier. I agree that I should have told you that I had additional
concerns, but I'm certain that Nan knew that from explicit requests
I made on the hard copy I gave her during my visit, as well as in
email messages. I'm not sure why you think it's appropriate for her
to ignore those requests.

I'm sorry that we have such different views about what constitures an
acceptable dissertation. Do you want to accept a thesis that doesn't
discuss related work carefully or that doesn't discuss limitations
of the approach? I'm nearly certain I asked Nan to address these in
my written comments. If you think they're not important, then you're
welcome to take that position, but I doubt that many CMU faculty
would agree with you.

I can provide more specific requests in this format before Monday,
but they'll focus on the high-level points I raised. I look forward
to hearing whether Nan wants this feedback from me. I understand
that you want to protect her from unreasonable requests, but I
think we should see whether she views them as unreasonable.

Best wishes, -Pat

P.S. I agree that my fourth point about hypotheses is debatable,
        but it's also the easiest to address. If Nan thinks that
        change is unnecessary, I won't insist on it.

I think it is appropriate to 100% appropriate to not respond to (let's
not say "ignore") those requests.  Pat, if you recall the timeline
was:

May 28 - defense
June 4 - Nan send out a revision plan -- no comments from you
June 12 - Nan sent out revisions -- no comments from you
June 26 - I sent you a reminder, asking for at least a schedule for
when you would provide comments.
Jul 1 - I sent another reminder
Jul 3 - I called you
Jul 5 - you responded with comments.

If I understand Nan's visa situation, she is basically barred from
making any income until she finishes her thesis, so delays are a real
hardship.  More generally, as a committee one of our priorities is to
give feedback in a timely way.  If Nan sent out a detailed plan for
revisions a full month ago, and you did NOT respond in a timely way,
but instead let her take weeks revising and waiting for your response,
and only THEN do you ask for additional changes, this isn't being
responsive - or responsible.

More generally, the committee approval process, as I understand it, is
NOT that all comments made by every committee member are addressed -
in general that's impossible, since requests can be contradictory.
Instead the committee meets, collectively decides on a limited list of
sufficient revisions which are immediately communicated to the
candidate and the rest of the committee.  That's what we did.  Do you
understand the process to be different?

Empirically, Pat, Ken's not the outlier here - everyone else on the
committee (and Tom, Ray and I have done a lot of thesis committees!)
has signed off already.  I don't think our ideas about what's a
reasonable thesis are unusual.

Again, I'd like to remind you that you asked to be on the committee -
and I'm assuming you knew more or less what was going to be in the
thesis, and what Ken and I consider acceptable, since Nan's been
publishing steadily.  What was the motivation? I'm assuming your goal
was to be involved in work you liked and respected, not to save
science from the flood of substandard students that Ken and I are
about to unleash on the world.

Again, it's not just protecting Nan - it's ensuring that the final
thesis, and the process that we use to get to it, satisfies our
standards of what's good science and responsible mentoring.  In short
there's another issue at stake here, which is whether Ken and I think
the revisions are unreasonable and/or appropriate.  Also, if there are
extensive changes in response to your feedback, then the other
committee members would be responsible for re-reading the revised
thesis.  Is it fair to ask them to do that?

Nan,

In response to Ken's suggestion, I'm writing with more detailed requests
for changes to your dissertation. I don't think these change the scope
of the thesis, and I hope you will be able to implement them without
too much time and effort. These are all similar to the points I raised
before, but I have repackaged them in ways that I hope will make them
more tractable.

I suggest that we limit new material to a few places, and that we keep
those as brief as possible:

1. In the discussion sections at the end of Chapters 3 through 8:

   a. Add one paragraph that clarifies which aspects of your approach
      or system you claim are psychologically plausible [in the sense
      they are consistent with generally accepted views about human
      cognition], which you do not view in that light, and any ideas
      you have about making the latter more consistent with established
      views [although the last item could be reserved for material on
      future work in the final chapter.] I'm guessing that six or so
      sentences would suffice in each case.

   b. Discuss alternative approaches that you might have used in
      your approach/system, and the reasons you selected the approach
      you did. This should cover issues like the representation of

      learned knowledge (e.g., grammar vs. discrimination network,
      symbolic vs. probabilistic), operators for taking steps through
      the space of candidates, and heuristics for guiding search. I
      see two ways you might organize these comments. One would
      be a separate paragraph with two or three sentences for each
      issue. Another would combine this when discussing how related
      work has adopted different approaches to the same problem.

   c. Discuss carefully how your approach relates to the most closely
      related work on the topic. For each comparison, note ways in

      which the two are similar, ways in which they differ, and the
      contribution your work makes. Since it's unrealistic to provide
      such a comparison for all cited systems, I suggest you take the
      most similar system in each chapter. E.g., Stolcke's scheme for
      for inducing context-free grammars by model merging is VERY
      similar to your own. Combined with your existing text, this would

      make your discussion sections much stronger. [I think your
      treatment of EPAM is already reasonable.]

2. At the end of Chapter 9, discuss the limitations of your system
   and outline ideas for addressing them in future research. Here
   are three points that you might discuss: (a) the nonincremental
   character of your learning methods and ideas for developing
   incremental variants; (b) the mongrel character of your various
   learning mechanisms and ways you might recast SimStudent
   in a unified theory of the cognitive architecture; and (c) the

   parametric character of your individual learner models and
   ways you might use SimStudent more directly to infer student
   knowledge states in the context of a tutoring system.

   I am not requesting that you specifically address these points,
   although I view all as limitations of the current framework.
   But I do care that you acknowledge explicitly that you work
   has drawbacks and that you have ideas about how to remedy
   them. I think you could do a reasonable job of this in just three
   paragraphs at the end of the chapter, then wrap up with a
   closing few sentences. [I see now that you discuss the idea
   of a more unified approach on page 86, but it's hidden amidst
   other text, rather than being discussed with other limitations.]

I hope that you find these suggestions both concrete and reasonable.
I believe they are similar to changes I requested in my hard-copy
comments, but repackaged to make them tractable in the short
time that's available. If you (or Ken or William) think these requests
are not specific enough, I can add detail, but my purpose is not
to tell you exactly what points to make, only to ask that you talk
about issues of psychological plausibility, design alternatives,
differences from prior work, and limitations.

Can you please let me know if you feel that making additions along
these lines would be both reasonable and doable in the time that
remains? Again, I don't think I

Nan,

Could you please tell me whether you are planning to incorporate
the additions to your dissertation that I have specified? William
has mentioned the possibility of removing me from your committee,
which I advise against, since it's likely to complicate things more
than simply making the changes I have indicated are needed.

I have thought about calling you to find out how things are going and
asking if you need any clarification, but Ken and William have asked
me not to contact you that way. I think that's counterproductive, but
I have abided by their wishes, so I hope you can respond to me
soon by email.

Best regards, -Pat

P.S. Once things calm down, I would like you to send me either the
        hard-copy comments I gave you in May or a scanned version of
        them for my records.

William and Ken,

Could you please tell me whether you and/or Nan are pursuing an
attempt to remove me from her thesis committee? If so, then can
you please tell me who you have approached about this action?
I would like to the chance to tell my side of the story before any
decision occurs.

Again, I hope Nan decides not to proceed down this path, and I hope
you are not advising her to take it. Given that the changes I have
specified are clearly related to the dissertation's academic quality,
any appeal process would bring that to light and could raise questions
about the reasons for removal.

Guys, can we please dial this all back a notch or two?

Pat,  I'm not sure precisely what I said about contacting Nan.  My
point was intended to be that we, as a committee, need to give Nan a
coherent, limited, actionable and consistent set revisions to do, and
in my experience, that process hasn't been for the committee to meet
and suggest revisions, not for individual members to discuss major
changes one-one with the candidate.  I'd like to keep that process, if
we can.

Part of this is of course that Ken and I, as advisors, want to be
happy with of the final product , and we want it to reflect Nan's
actual outlook and abilities - so if we perceive changes as negative,
or excessive, we need to have a voice.  Eg, we might feel that too
many discussions along the lines of "what I didn't do this instead"
are not helpful.  We might feel that micro-managing a thesis beyond a
certain point is inappropriate - that it's better to have a thesis
reflect a limited (but still acceptable for a young researcher) view
of the field and literature that actually reflects what the candidate
knows, than spending an inordinate amount of time micro-guiding her to
some other view.  (Pat Langley has already written his thesis, you
don't need to do another by remote control).  So we need to have a
mature respectful discussion about this - not a series of "my way or
the highway" arguments.  Please let's try to do that - which I think
includes you respecting our assessments as scientists, as well as vice
versa.

The other issue is timeliness. When I'm an outside reader, I try to
produce a list of specific changes (short enough for me to at least
remember afterward) and communicate them clearly to the candidate and
advisor - not just a copyedited MS, which can't be easily shared with
the committee and discussed.   If I wanted a complete rewrite or
thought the candidate was just below theshold I would give that
feedback BEFORE the defense.  Ken and I obviously wanted to give Nan
specific actionable suggestions as soon as possible, which is why we
sent out a summary of the committee's suggestions, including many of
yours, shortly after the defense, why Nan sent out a detailed plan for
revisions to you, and why we gave you time to respond.  It's very
frustrating to have this rather effortful communication ignored (for
whatever reason).  We've all had the experience of journal papers
where in each round, there long delays before getting the next set of
 set of new and incompatible revisions - right now that would be Nan's
subjective impression, and I'm upset by that.   This is water under
the bridge but I hope we agree that we should all work as hard as
possible to avoid any future delays and/or review iterations.

William,

I appreciate your efforts to keep the discussion civil. I'll try to
respond to all of your points later today, but I'm hoping you can
answer a key question first.

I have asked Nan to make some specific changes to her thesis
that should not take her long and that I don't see as controversial
in terms of content. Can you please tell me whether you find any
of my requests inappropriate or harmful to the dissertation?

If so, then could you please tell me which you find problematic?
I'm not talking about whether you think I'm not giving Nan enough
authorial control, but whether you think specific changes, if they
were implemented, would make for a worse thesis.

If you or Ken don't object to the content, then my view is that Nan
should implement the changes and send me the text so I can sign
off on the document.

Best, -Pat

That's great to hear. Does that mean that your (and Ken's) objections
to the changes I've requested are procedural in character, as Ken has
suggested this at times?

I should clarify that I don't care especially about the PAMI paper, which
I found after a brief Web search. I care that, in each content chapter,
Nan select at least one piece of work that she considers close to her
own and compare/contrast them in some detail (at the level of six or so
sentences).

William,

I'll be happy to step down from DEFCON 2, but I believe you were
the one who first mentioned removing me from the committee. That
felt like stepping things up to me.

> I'm not sure precisely what I said about contacting Nan.

One of you asked that I not call Nan directly, but I was mainly asking
about Nan contacting me. She has only responded to one of my
messages, and her tone there was more formal than I've ever seen
it. So I inferred that one or both of you had advised her to communicate
with me only through you. If so, I think that was poor advice, since it
slows things down drastically.

I agree that consistency is important, but, on every committee I've
ever served on in the past, that's been mediated through the student.
Each committee member makes comments on the draft thesis and
the student decides if s/he has received conflicting requests. If not,
then the student makes the changes. Insisting that the committee
members reach consensus is much more time consuming and, in
many cases, impractical, and it's likely to lower the overall quality
of the final dissertation.

You certainly deserve to have input about requests that you view as
negative or excessive. Ken's objection to my point about psychological
plausibility (as strange as I found it) was reasonable (we have very
different views), so I rephrased things in a way I thought he would
find acceptable. I have told Nan that my most recent round of detailed
comments are optional, even though they included some serious
syntactic and technical errors that would be easily repaired.

> Eg, we might feel that too many discussions along the lines of "what
> I didn't do this instead" are not helpful.

Feeling that something is "not helpful" is different from feeling its
inclusion would make the thesis worse. If any committee member
asks for a change and the advisor(s) do not think it will weaken the
final product, then I don't think they have reason to object.

The requests I originally sent last week were high level and focused
on topics that I think every thesis should include, regardless of the
author's interests or writing style: design designs, theoretical claims,
comparison and contrast with closely related work, and limitations /
future work. I provided details about how to proceed only in response
to Ken's request, which I thought was reasonable, because Nan did
not seem to be understanding what I wanted.

> (Pat Langley has already written his thesis, you don't need to do
> another by remote control).

I understand your point, but I don't think that's what's been going
on. I've been trying to ensure that Nan's thesis meets some minimum
standards of academic quality. I honestly think the dissertation is
very poorly organized and written, and the most recent requests I
have made are a major reduction over what I would really like.

> So we need to have a mature respectful discussion about this - not

Of course. I have tried to be civil in the discussion, but if you
think I'm not, please point it out. But, as a committee member, I
believe I'm entitled to make reasonable requests for changes to
the thesis, and I think that's what I've done. Ken, at least, has
been rejecting my requests, as though I'm behaving inappropriately,
and I think he's been out of line in doing so.

I sent such a list last Sunday. It's probably not short enough for you
to remember it, but it's not especially long, either. It was certainly
not a copyedited manuscript. I did send detailed comments to Nan, but,
as I said, they're optional.

> If I wanted a complete rewrite or thought the candidate was just

I disagree with this position. Many Stanford students defend before
they even have a complete first draft, and much of the writing and
revision occurs afterward. But I have been giving Nan feedback for
a long time about the need to discuss design decisions, separate
theory from implementation, and examine related work carefully, and
she has either misunderstood or chosen to ignore my requests. It's
not fair to penalize me for insisting upon them again at this stage
when she's had plenty of time to address them.

I understand, and I apologize again for not responding to the email
on these topics. I have explained my extenuating circumstances, but I
agree that I made an awkward situation worse by not responding in a
timely manner. However, we can't change that now and we can only
make the best of the situation we're in.

I agree, but we've also interacted with authors of journal submissions
who, despite our repeated requests for certain changes, cannot seem
to address them as we desire. That's how I perceive Nan's lack of
responses to my continuing requests. The changes I've been asking
for are not new, and they're greatly reduced from what I really want.
I think the best way to avoid further delays is for Nan to acknowledge
my latest specific requests, begin to incorporate them, and end the
communications blackout so we can discuss any questions she has
about them.

Best wishes, -Pat

Nan,

Can you please tell me how you're planning to respond about the
material I have asked you to add to your thesis? William has said
that he does not object to any of the additions in terms of content,
although I don't know about Ken. Again, if you have any questions
about what I would like to see, just let me know.

Thanks, -Pat

Dear all,

I have been traveling and finally come back. Here is the plan for the
possible changes I will make inlined in your comments. Please take a
look and let me know what you think. Thanks a lot!

- Section 3.3. Please add to this section:



 (1) A brief paragraph (three or four sentences) about which aspects

      of your system you view as making theoretical claims about human

      cognition and which you do not. E.g., you might state a commitment

      to your representation (with or without the probabilities) but not

      to the performance and learning mechanisms.



I have discussed this at the end of page 4.



 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and differs

      from, Stolcke's system in terms of representation, operators for

      generating candidate grammars, search organization, and evaluation

      function for guiding that search. Acknowledge that, except for

      the "feature learning" mechanism, your approach is nearly identical

      to Stolcke's system, and remove claims that his work (and similar

      work by others) does not address representation learning.



I will add some discussion about this in Section 3.3. Stolke’s system
uses merging and chunking operators, whereas our system greedily
creates new nonterminals including recursive grammar rules. Plus, our
system is integrated with skill learning, which is not the focus of
Stolke’s system.



 (3) A few sentences that explain why you chose to approach perceptual

      learning in terms of context-free grammars rather than using

      discrimination nets or connectionist models, both of which have

      a longer history in cognitive psychology. Alternatively, you can

      discuss this at the end of (1) or even in a few sentences at the

      end of the EPAM paragraph.



I have added some discussion in the second but last paragraph of page
88 that discussed one experiment where we compared our approach with a
connectionist model that is closest to our work, deep belief network,
and showed that it did not perform as effective as the proposed model.



- Section 4.4. Please add to this section:



 (1) A brief paragraph (three or four sentences) about which aspects

      of your system you view as making theoretical claims about human

      cognition and which you do not. E.g., your key claim might be

      that parsing based on a perceptual grammar determines how the

      learner explains observed steps in a problem solution, but not

      the details of how this takes place.



I will add some discussion towards the end of Section 4.4, stating
that our claim is representation learning is one of the essential
aspects of human knowledge acquisition, and should be modeled in
learning agents. We presented one possible implementation of such
integration, but this may not be the only way.



 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and how

      it differs from, either Neves' early approach to learning in

      algebra or, preferably, its relation to Jones and VanLehn's

      Cascade model, which filled in gaps in worked-out solutions

      to physics problems.



I will add some discussion in Section 4.4 stating Neve’s system
assumes the representation of the problem is given, whereas our
approach automatically acquires such representation. I believe this is
also true for the Cascade model.



 Since this section is already reasonably long, I won't ask you to

 discuss design alternatives. Some variant on explanation-based

 learning seems like the obvious approach.



Section 5.5. Please add to this section:



 (1) A paragraph about which aspects of your system you view as making

      theoretical claims about human cognition and which you do not.

      Presumably this will be similar to the statement for Chapter 3,

      with the additional statement that perceptual grammars involve

      two dimensions, as do the resulting parse trees. Include a few

      sentences that explain why you chose to approach perceptual

      learning in terms of grammars rather than, say, discrimination

      networks or even multi-layer connectionist models. This can repeat

      the arguments from Chapter 3.



I will repeat the argument added in Chapter 3.



 (2) A paragraph that discusses how your work is similar to, and how

      it differs from, some other system that learns pCFGs for either

      displays or images. The current text suggests (but does not state

      explicitly) that noone else has developed a system that learns

      2D grammatical structures, but the paper



     Zu, L., Chen, Y., & Yuille, A. (2009). Unsupervised learning of

        probabilistic grammar-Markov models for object categories. IEEE

        Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31.

        http://people.csail.mit.edu/leozhu/paper/TPAMI-2007-03-0146-2.pdf



      appears to address the same issue pretty directly. I'm not sure why

      Ray Mooney didn't point you to this work. I don't care in particular

      about this paper, but I think you should devote at least a few

      sentences to comparing you approach to one similar system.



The above paper uses a different model and thus cannot be directly
applied to 2-D pCFG learning. Adding this discussion may be beyond the
scope of this thesis.



Section 6.4. Please add to this section:



 (1) A brief paragraph about whether you are making any psychological

      claims about this module (I'm guessing these are minimal), as

      well as what alternatives you considered in addressing the task.

      In particular, I'd like to hear why you decided that methods for

      defining new predicates from the ILP community were not enough

      for your needs, especially since some of them (especially those

      involving inverse resolution) involve introducing nonterminals

      in simple grammars.



 (2) A paragraph that discusses two efforts that focused on revising

      or extending representation in the context of problem solving:

      Utgoff's thesis work and our joint work on learning predicates

      for use in Icarus skills. Explain how your approach is similar,

      how it differs, and why you needed new mechanisms.



  Also, please rewrite the sentence "...there has been considerable

  work on representation change...little has occurred in the context

  of representation learning", which does not make sense to me. If

  you think these two tasks are distinct, you should explain that

  difference here and, hopefully, much earlier.



I will change representation learning to perceptual-level
representation learning to clarify what I meant. I have also added
discussion in the last paragraph of page 88 repeating this difference.



Section 7.5. This section seems so weak that I'm not sure what

  revisions to request. You cite only one paper on article selection

  and that appears to report an empirical study. Since the chapter

  is ostensibly about representation learning in the context of

  background knowledge, I would have expected you to discuss at

  least some work on the latter topic. The work you cover seems

  marginally related and reads like filler. I don't honestly think

  you can salvage this section without a complete rewrite, which

  I don't feel is reasonable to request at this point, but I think

  it's important that you understand how the text falls short.



Section 8.8. Please correct the problems I mentioned in the detailed

  comments I sent yesterday. These include:



  (1) Reorder your text about Debuggy, LMS, ACM (Langley/Ohlsson),

       and Baffes/Mooney to reflect the dates they were published,

       since earlier efforts influenced later ones. Also, describe

       the Langley/Ohlsson work as using machine learning but not the

       Conati/VanLehn work. Also, I would be very happy to see you

       add a paragraph that discusses how your approach differs from,

       and is similar to, Conati's work, but I won't insist on it.



I will reorder the text accordingly, and not referring Conati and
VanLehn’s work as using machine learning, but Bayesion networks.



  (2) In the third paragraph, revise the third sentence to state

       something like "Although these did not focus on modeling

       how representation change affects skill learning, work by

       Utgoff (1984) and by Li et al. (2012) has done so." Then

       add one sentence on each system that notes its contribution

       to this topic. [To be honest, I don't know why you have

       this paragraph here, since it's only marginally relevant

       to the chapter, but, if you're going to include it, it should

       be technically accurate.]



I will restate the sentence.



Chapter 9. Please add, at the end of this chapter, a few paragraphs

      that discuss limitations of your framework and some ideas on

      how to address them in future research. I see now that you

      mention one or two limitations in earlier chapters, but you

      were not consistent about that, and I think the material makes

      more sense here. This request did not appear in the list that

      Ken compiled, but the thesis will be incomplete without it.



I have added discussions in the last chapter suggesting possible
future studies, and stated that the use of perceptual learning is a
key feature of SimStudent.

Best,
Nan

This looks reasonable.  It is hard to judge whether it will be acceptable to Pat given the replies are brief, especially the first one.  If you made that (and other) changes already, you might send them.

One comment on #3: the reason for the choice is a question of history, not of computer science. The more fundamental question is whether there are important differences between the approaches.

The original reason might simply be because it seemed it might solve the problem at hand. The history does not matter, but it does matter how it compares to other approaches. Isn't that what you are reasonably after, Pat?

BTW I'm back Pat - feel free to call between 2:30 and 5:30 EST today
if you like.

After seeing your (Pat's) clarification to Nan's response, I'm happy
with some of the requests, and less happy with others.  As I said
before, I don't object to the specific requests as you (Pat) stated
them - but am I concerned that you seems to have very specific
revisions in mind, and in light of the long delays waiting for Pat's
response to Nan's proposed revisions, I'd like the revision process to
be quick if possible - it doesn't help to say the revisions will be a
paragraph or so of extra text each if we must iterate multiple times
over each new sentence.  Let me break down my reactions (since we've
decided from prior discussion that they are of some importance here).

2,3) Wrt Stolke's thesis, it fine approprate to have more discussion
about this, and more detail on the grammar learning method, if Pat
requires it.

1) Wrt page 4, and the theory/implementation issue: Pat, why is this
discussion insufficient? to help clarify what you want, can you point
Nan (and all of us) to other recent publications where the sort of
discussion you'd like to see appears, so we can understand what you
mean? if you can't, can you articulate to us why it's necessary in
this thesis, although it's not standrd practice in the literature?

I have more to say about this..... I think I'm old enough to
understand what you want, but I disagree about its desirability.  In
particular, I'd like to observe that in old-style AI it's often useful
to make a distinction between theory and implementation.  In many old
AI papers, (my thesis, eg) one has a wordy and imprecise description
of a "theory" that is then tested on, if anything, a small set of
more-or-less artificial examples.  In this setting it's important to
separate the claims about the theory from the experimental
evidence/implementation, since the implementation is usually only
partial, and the computations are only illustrative.  It's also
important to be able to argue coherently the merits and novelty of the
"theory", because "progress" in the form of coming up with better
theories is the goal of the work.  In practise this methodology
usually degrades into a beauty contest between (arguments about)
imprecise "theories", backed by limited actual data.

In quantitatively experimental work, this distinction is less
important, and being able to cogently present beauty-contest arguments
is a far less important skill.  It's enough to say: here is data (in
this case, human-student data); here's how we modeled it; here are the
results.  Progress is made largely by getting better numbers.  If
someone has a better cognitive model/theory, then that can be
quantatively demonstrated----you don't need to make an in-depth
argument for the case.

In short, Pat, I question your premise that the skill you're asking
Nan is important, and suggest that it will seem like an awkward
distinction and a distraction from the flow of the thesis for most
readers.

AS A COMPROMISE, I suggest adding a short section in the future work
where Nan gives a SMALL NUMBER of examples of plausible variant
implementations (eg swapping out FOIL, or pCFG's, for something
different) and giving pointers to the literature suggesting why they
might be plausible.  This will give us an idea of Nan's views (not
Pat's views, which are not appropriate to present here) of what's the
abstract "core" of the work, and what might be usefully varied,
without getting into a hard-to-define "theory vs implementation"
discussion.

4) This seems to be a request for what I'd said I prefer NOT to see in
revisions, ie, an extensive discussion of not what Nan did (in this
case pCFGs) but what she didn't do (nets).  In an experimental ML
work, where someone is announcing empirical results on a new problem,
I feel it is NOT appropriate to ask the author to experimentally
compare to every conceiveable prior approach, only to approaches that
have in fact been applied to the same data (or to very similar tasks).
In particular, it's not appropriate to ask the author of an
experimental paper to speculate at length on how plausible-sounded but
not-yet-experimentally-tried methods would work on the data at hand.

Again, on experimental tasks, the burden should be on the
authors/proponents of alternative methods to SHOW that they work,
rather than putting a burden on experimentalists to argue that
alternatives will NOT work.  In my experience such informal arguments
are often incorrect - and unnecessary since any performance claim is
actually testable.

AS A COMPROMISE, I'd like to propose the following guidelines for
adding this sort of discussion here: asking for an additional
sentence, or so in the related work section(s), of the form:
"Alternative approaches to the problem of XXXXX have been proposed in
the past: e.g., XXXX proposed using XXXX, and evaluated it on ....;
and .....  It is not clear from prior experiments how these
alternative approaches would perform experimentally on the XXXX data
considered here."  If Nan wants to add additional justifications (eg
"We adopted this approach for historical reasons" or "We adopted this
based on the intuition that ....." I don't object but I'd like any
such the additions should be SHORT and FOCUSED so they don't distract
from the descriptions of what was actually done.

The committee would be responsible for giving operational pointers to
the work to be discussed (which Pat has in some cases, as I see) and
where the discussion should be placed.

I'm sorry I didn't respond to your comments last night, but I was
preparing my talk. I'm working on responses now, but let me note
that one way to speed up the process would be to agree with my

Pat, believe it or not, I'm trying my best to speed up this process,
and I'd be happy to publicly agree with anything you say if it will
get Nan thru any faster.  I agreed to two of your specific requests,
and only objected to ones that seemed difficult for you to communicate
to Nan (as well as to me) and/or which seemed to be out of scope or
ill-defined, and which would therefor be difficult to perform
promptly.  From your text you say things like, "you don't understand
what I'm asking and may not understand the difference", "I don't see
it as an argument at all", "I think you've misunderstood me" - which
is not encouraging if we're trying to converge here.  And my
objections were proposing what I believe to be reasonable compromises,
and I spent a long time explaining them in my response.

Remember, you've had all of June and half of July to communicate, as
well as several weeks with the thesis before the defense, and these
are the second round of revisions we're talking about, after several
weeks of revisions that you approved Nan doing (at least tacitly, but
not objecting to a specific revision plan).  Four other senior
researchers have approved the thesis as it stands.

Again let me remind you that, as I understand it, Nan cannot start her
job until this is all over, so delays are a concrete financial
hardship.  I'm looking forward to your reasonable, collegial and
prompt discussion of my compromise proposal to satisfy your
requirements with minimal time and effort for all of us, by
operationalizing and making concrete your suggested revisions.

I do not have specific revisions in mind, but I do have specific types
of revisions in mind. I have no desire to tell Nan what content she
should include, only what types of content.

Agreed.

The reason I provided the detailed example for Stolcke's work was
that it had become clear Nan did not understand what I had in mind.
I hope she can generalize to other examples she discusses. I think
it's important that she stays on topic, such as not mentioning use
for skill learning as a distinguishing feature in a chapter that's
not about that issue.

The final paragraph on page 4 includes some comments about distinctive
contributions of the thesis as a whole. One might also take these as
statements about theoretical commitments, but the reader cannot be
sure without additional statements that other aspects of the system
do not have that status. I'm asking that Nan distinguish between those
aspects of her work that she views as having theoretical status and
those which do not. Of course, she cannot list all of the latter, but
she can say that they are implementation details that, if someone
implemented them another way, would not matter to the main claims.

In addition, I'm asking that Nan make the theory/implementation
distinction clear for most of the chapters. Each of those reports
a new component of the overall system and, presumably, makes some
theoretical contribution to the whole. One reason this is important
is that it interacts with the discussion of previous work. E.g., if
the theoretical claims for grammar induction were the same as those
Stolcke made (I don't think they are, although they are close), then
that chapter would make no theoretical contribution. It's important
to be clear about such matters.

I think you've misread me. I'm not suggesting that Nan make this
distinction in homage to early-style AI, but because it's central to
the scientific process. Nan is extending a theory of skill learning,
but one can only test theories in the context of specific models.
These make theories operational by adding auxiliary assumptions
(in this case, running code) that has little theoretical important.
However, the aim is not to draw conclusions about the code but about
the theory, which is difficult to do unless one calls it out separately.

The distinction remains very important. Evidence for theories is
always indirect in science, since it's always tied to models, but
that does not eliminate the need for making the distinction.

I have asked that Nan add one paragraph about this issue in the
discussion sections for a number of chapters. This seems like a
perfectly valid topic for discussion sections, and I don't see how
it would interrupt the flow.

I appreciate the constructive suggestion. I would have been happy
with this approach if each chapter discussed its own directions for
future work, since the new content could be embedded there. Lacking
that, I still think she should discuss the theory/implementation
distinction in each chapter for which I have requested it because,
presumably, each of them makes different theoretical contributions.

I'm not sure why you keep hinting that I want to impose my specific
views. I have intuitions about the interesting theoretical claims,
but I'm far more interested in Nan stating her views as evidence
that she understands, and can communicate, her contributions.

I'm not sure what specific point you mean here, but I'm guessing
you're referring to my requests (in multiple chapters) that Nan
discuss alternative approaches she might have taken and the reasons
she pursused the path she did. Even in an advanced engineering
field like machine learning (and, of course, Nan's thesis also
has psychological implications), I think an author should still
discuss design alternatives and give intuitions for the selected
approach. This places the work in a broader context and clarifies
the author's line of reasoning for the reader. I have not asked
for new experiments or treatment of all possible alternatives,
only discussion of a few obvious alternatives that will not take
much time to provide.

intuitive arguments for why she made the design decisions she did.

Again, I appreciate the constructive suggestions. In the latest round
of requests, I suggested that Nan devote a few sentences to this
matter in the discussion section of most chapters. I'm not sure
how this differs from your proposal. But I'm really not looking for
discussion of empirical capabilities, as you seem to have inferred.
In my mind, it would be more natural to make arguments of consistency
with accepted psychological theory (although Ken might reject that),
consistency with earlier versions of SimStudent (context-free grammars
seem like a natural extension of the earlier perceptual encoding), or
consistency with extensions introduced in earlier chapters. Mainly,
I just want to see evidence that Nan was aware that alternatives
exist and that she had reasons for making the choices she did. I
agree that these statements can be short and focused.

> The committee would be responsible for giving operational pointers

I have also made suggestions about placement, but I care less about
that than that Nan addresses I've noted at the length I have requested.
For example, if I've asked her to discuss a point separately in three
different chapters, she should do that rather than discuss it once in
the introduction or conclusion. And if I've asked her to provide a
paragraph of material, she should do that rather than add a sentence.

I look forward to hearing whether you think we're close to converging.
My general view is that, unless you think adding the material I have
requested will actually detract from the final thesis, then you (and Ken)
should approve its inclusion and let Nan incorporate them. I hope my
responses have clarified why I've been making some requests and
the ways in which I'd like Nan to address them.

Best wishes, -Pat

I believe that and I appreciate that. I didn't mean to suggest that
you were trying to be obstructive, only that it take two (or more)
to disagree about something. I hope you understand that I have
reduced my requests far beyond what I would normally ask

To clarify, I mean "specific" in the sense that there is a high
probability that a response that some might see reasonable (eg myself)
would be viewed by you as unacceptable, so we'll have to iterate
multiple times to finish.  I want to minimize/eliminate "specific"

RESPOND PLEASE: Since we agree that we want to shorten this process,
could we agree as a principle on "no revisions that require
'generalizing'"  to infer what you have in mind?  I'd like to have a
clearly defined, finite, extensional list of things to fix: you
volunteered for this job, you owe it to Nan to provide that.

Fine, but opinions about this clearly differ.   Earlier you argued
that your requested additions would not require additional review by
the rest of the committee, are you now arguing that this principle
should be applied to things you'd like deleted as well?  I'll repeat
the claim that consideration to your colleagues on the committee
requires you to circumscribe your requests as much as possible.  If
this is only a digression, then can we just let it lie?

As I argued, the theory, as opposed to the code, is a hypothetical
beast.  You're basically saying here that you want the reader to draw
one set of conclusions from the data instead of another, based on an
informal argument.  Fine, I agree this happens sometimes in practice,
and maybe it's even sometimes valuable, but it's not what I prefer to
see as a matter of course.

Ok, I see you disagree with me, but you make no argument, only a bald
assertion that my adjectives are wrong.  Quantitive research makes a
contribution - just as an experiment makes a contribution - and to
claim that its "very important" to spin the data in a particular way,
via the lens of a theory, rather than allow the reader to draw his/her
own conclusions, is an opinion.  I'm happy to respect that opinion,
Pat, if you will respect my opinion as well, by carefully considering
the operationalization of the request.

My other concern here is that again, I'm worried that you have a
"specific" [see above] definition of theory and that we're going to
iterate until Nan "generalizes" from your advice and gets the right
answer.   This is inefficient, and will not reflect Nan's belief.

If you insist on an additional discussion, I prefer that it's in one
place, so Ken and I can read it together, and Nan can write it in one
go.  Since you would have been happy with this approach with a
slightly different organization of the thesis, can you accept this
compromise solution, which will make the process quicker I believe
(which we've agreed is a goal) and which doesn't affect the content?
If it's simply a preference ("I think she should") maybe this is a
good chance for you to demonstrate your willingness to compromise and
show your respect the opinions of me and the other committee members?

RESPOND PLEASE: However, I notice that you do not accept the
suggestion, only "appreciate it".  Can we then assume that it's ok it
Nan will simply discuss these variants, or is the compromise
constructive but not somehow not acceptable?  PLEASE BE CLEAR in your
responses so we can keep the discussion moving forward.

If you do insist on a theory/implementation distinction, I'd like to
repeat my earlier request:

I assume that this should be easy for you to do, given the importance
you've attached to the theory/implementation distinction above.  It
may be that you and I are just talking about something completely
different here.

Excellent - I'm very glad we agree with that.  As I said above, I was
worried we'd be iterating until you see a "right" answer - thesis
writing by generate-and-test - which I see you agree would be
horrible.  Can we then agree that we'll wait and see what Nan writes
in response to your theory/implementation clarification issue - and
then simply accept it for what it is, ie the candidates opinion,
without any additional iteration beyond typos and such?  RESPOND
PLEASE

than "multiple"?

Again, the burden should, in my view, be on the proponents of these
alternatives to show IF they work, not on Nan to SPECULATE on whether
they will.   We may disagree; I'd like to ask you to respect my views
as to what constitutes solid science and NOT ask Nan for additions of
this sort in the thesis which I feel will take a lot of time, be
difficult to reach closure on, and ultimately lower the quality of the
thesis with a lot of imprecise speculation.  RESPOND PLEASE.
You're asking for more than I said - my template doesn't ask for
reasons for making the choices - which again, I feel is too open-ended
for rapid convergence.  I want a closed, extensional list of revisions
that we will agree on now.

After reading your last .txt attachment I was quite worried as to
whether you are converging to a closed set of requests, or maintaining
a long list of open-ended revisions that will not be quickly
satisfiable.  I've tried to clarify the concerns in this email and
make the revisions less onerous, more precise, and easier to address.
I also completely approved two of them (which I assume Nan is smart
enough to just get started on).

I'm glad that we agree to be respectful and prompt, and to try and get
Nan through this - and I hope that by taking this active role with
you, you and Nan will iterate less than you otherwise would

> My general view is that, unless you think adding the material I have

As you see above, there are some additions that I feel WILL detract.
I hope that your "unless" means that you will respect my view as a
scientist, and as Nan's advisor, and drop the requests that we
disagree about.

Pat, in reviewing the email, I noted that it was actually you, not me,
that broached forcible removal.  I'm not advocating that but I'd like
to remind you that you did volunteer - apparently knowing that you
would require contentious revisions - and that you can, at any time,
voluntarily resign (since Nan's committee is complete without you),
thus ending our disagreements, freeing up your time, and releasing you
from having to sign off on a thesis that you clearly have grave
misgivings about.  I'm not asking you too - I'm just saying that you
can't really complain here :-)

Also, not to add to the pressure unduly, but Nan has no parallel
commitments until this is over (and, from what I've seen doesn't sleep
much either) - it is for her sake that I am harassing you.  I look
forward to your prompt response to my last message.

That's very odd, because I remember it as coming from you or Ken,
possibly over the phone, with you being the first to mention it in email.

I don't think I would have raised the idea because I have never heard
of it happening, and I was shocked to see it mentioned in writing.

If we simply miscommunicated in the heat of the moment, I'm glad to
hear that, as it reassures me that we're working together on this.

Hi Nan,

Two things:
1. Srini is suggesting he intervene and set a deadline of a week for your revisions.  Does next week work for you as the week in which you make final revisions?

2. In the time you have now, it makes to make as many revisions as you can.  Do you have a sense for which reviews you can make (most easily or most effectively) to address Pat's requests?  We can talk on the phone if not.  Give me a call or a text if so.

Hi Ken,

1. Great! Yes, I should have time next week in making revisions, but
may not be able to do it full-time.
2. For some of the ones, I feel that I know what Pat is asking, but I
don't know whether it is good to put it in the thesis. For example,
comment 1, "making theoretical claims about human cognition and which
you do not". I can, of course, add a separate paragraph that discusses
this, but I somehow feel it hurts the current flow of the thesis.
Also, adding discussion on Stolke's work that is as detailed as Pat
pointed out does not seem natural to me, as this is not a survey
paper, and we do not discuss other related work at that level of
details. Maybe I am wrong. Adding these discussions will help improve
the thesis. At the high level, my question is that should I make the
changes as Pat wants so that we can finish soon, or should I only make
changes that I feel comfortable.

With that said, I believe I know what are the ones that I can make
changes. I will look at Pat's latest comments again later today, and
send a list on the ones that I think I can address effectively.

Would that be good? Thanks!

Best,
Nan

Pat, I'm quite concerned that we're not making progress here - not
only between you and me/Ken, but more importantly, that after spending
so much time discussing the several revisions you requested on July 7,
we haven't crossed a single one off the list (as far as I can see).
As we approach the 2-month anniversary of the defense, and pass the
ten-day anniversary of anything looking like progress in completing
the thesis, I feel that this is something we should all be concerned
with - which is why I spent so much time trying to clarify, and make
finite and precise, the July 7 revision list Pat sent out.

Nan, you should certainly continue to address the current set of
revisions - the most recent ones, as I clarified them - while we await
Pat's response.

Guys, please respond to this new thread, the old one is getting
unwieldy in my favorite readers.

This may be the best approach given our new CMU-imposed deadlines -
however, I'd like to note that the process, and necessity for it,
makes me uncomfortable.  On the 30 prior thesis committees I've been
on, there's never been the need for more than 2 rounds of revisions,
and we're now at round 4, and talking about tens (hundreds?) of
micro-iterations.  This is disturbing.  Without a deadline, it's
clearly unworkable, since your response times have ranged from hours
to weeks.

Always is a strong term.  To clarify, you're saying here that this
always happens in some latent, unobservable state in the scientists
mind? But clearly not that it is always articulated in papers, as you
require Nan to do?  Most of the thesis is already out in the
literature in 6-8 conference papers and several journal subs - does
this mean we're done here, since she's made this separation as
scientists "always" do?

Or does this always happen in some subset of "good" science, which
does not include her prior publications? what other fraction of
published work is not included in "always"?

So to summarize: no, you don't accept this?

Pat, these examples are all from your work (and hence maybe your own
ideosyncratic view which others don't or can't adopt) and/or from a
long time ago. Quinlan's paper I know well, he has a nice abstract
description of the algorithm - which Nan's thesis is littered with! -
but I don't see what you're calling a theory/mplementation
distinction.  He certainly doesn't spend much time discussing
alternative algorithms that haven't yet been implemented, as you
request.  Or am I missing something?

To summarize, no?

Again, to summarize "no".

Procedurally, if you and I disagree, what's the solution?  Is it "my
way or the highway", or is there any way that you'd like to see this
adjucated?  Perhaps we could ask Ray or Tom to referee?  Or, is there
anyone else in the community that you'd prefer to step in and act as
arbitrator? (I'd like to exclude former students or others that might
have a strong COI with you, but otherwise I'm open).

Pat, I just spoke to Nan.  My main concerns about your requests were
that they are not actionable enough for Nan to converge in a
reasonable time, and would lead to imprecise and conjectural
discussions.  However, in light of Srini's deadline and your position,
I think the only real option is to attempt to nail them down.  This is
my current proposal.

Nan starts revising the thesis to respond to Pat's email of Sun, Jul
7, 2013 at 7:30 PM (msg1.txt attached) as clarified by his later
attachment send July 15, starting with the ones that I responded to as
approved (if indeed she hasn't already started).  After that, she
begins working on the fuzzier issues around theory-vs-implementation
and design decisions.  Since I don't want these discussions at all, I
strongly prefer that they be confined to a final conclusions chapter -
however, this is up to Nan.  Nan will send revisions out to all of us
and if I strongly object to a discussion as too vague I will respond.

Nan and Pat are welcome to correspond to clarify other issues at their
convenience, but are requested to CC me.  If you have a non-email
interaction, I have asked Nan to send a summary to all of us right
after, including a list if the action items that she will undertake in
response.  By Srini's rules this process will end Monday, and Nan will
continue work and submit a final version by Friday 7/26.

Nan, you are, of course, welcome to contact me at any time.  Pat, you
might not want to go thru with the phone call at 8pm given my revised
position, but you're welcome to call regardless.

- W

Dear Nan,

William and I talked on the phone this evening and we have agreed
that you can discuss your theoretical claims in the final chapter,
provided you place them in a separate section and devote a separate
paragraph to most of the earlier chapters. I say "most" because
I think Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the important ones, and I will
not mind if you forgo Chapters 7 and 8.

I also wanted to clarify what I'm looking for in this discussion.
Briefly, I want you to state clearly which aspects of each module
you consider central to your contributions. You need not state
these features are the way humans operate, although that's one
type of claim you could make. You might instead claim that you
believe they provide the main source of power in, say, increasing
learning rate or transfer.

The key idea is that you distinguish the high-level features you
view as important, as opposed to the many implementation details
that, one might hope, would not alter the qualitative character
of your results. You might take the position that all the details
of your algorithms (at the pseudocode level) are essential but not
the specific implementations, although I doubt you believe that.

For instance, in discussing Chapter 3, you might claim that the
important ideas are the use of contex-free grammars to encode
perceptual chunks, the incorporation of probabilities on those
grammars, the use of the latter in finding a likely parse tree,
and various aspects of your method for learning those grammars.

However, you might want to claim more than that, since the
items I just listed would not distinguish your work from Stolcke's
(which is why I've asked that you discuss it in some detail).
For example, you might want to emphasize your system's use
of the learned grammars to create new features, which in turn
offer improved learning and transfer on certain types of tasks.

Some features that you might feel are not central, and thus not
worth calling out, are the specific variant of the EM algorithm
you employed (although maybe you do think that's important) or
the nonincremental character of your learning method. You need
not discuss these explicitly, since there are too many to cover;
you just need to be careful to describe the key ideas in ways
that do not include or assume them.

I hope these comments have clarified what I have in mind and,
to some extent, why I think adding this material is necessary.
Although your current draft shows the impressive work you have
done for the thesis, you also want readers to come away with
a clear idea about what you consider its main contributions to
the theory of human and/or machine learning. They should be
able to reimplement these ideas in different code and still
acknowledge that they are building on your solid beginnings.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send email or
call me. I have meetings on Friday afternoon, so response to
email will be slow then, but I can interrupt for a few minutes
if you need to talk.

Best regards, -Pat

P.S. If you decide to discuss these issues in the final chapter,
        I think it's also important to note in the introduction that
        you'll be doing that, so readers do not expect it sooner.
