<h2>What I did</h2>
<pre>

 - I used Yahoo Site explorer and wget to download 1000 pages from
 dailykos and redstate.com.  I believe this is the top 1000 pages on
 the site by #inlinks.  I filtered these to get blog entries, including
 comments.

 - I extracted the words from dkos & redstate blog entries, and the
 corresponding comments, using a perl script (that uses an extendable
 perl HTML parser, and site-specific "class" tags on the comment and
 entry DOM nodes).  The redstate comments are a little messier, since
 I could not easily strip out signatures.

 - I tokenized, stoplisted, counted a bunch of word frequencies, and
 saved all the words that appear >= 5 times in dkos entries, redstate
 entries, dkos comments, redstate comments, etc.

 - I estimating a bunch of relative-frequency/MI sort of statistics.
 What seemed most reasonable was to look for "non-general English"
 words that are "more common in context X than context Y", which
 I express with this score

 log[ P(w|X) / P(w|Y)*P(w|GE) ]

 Stats for "general English" were from the brown corpus.  I smoothed
 with a Dirichlet, and probably more importantly, by replacing zero
 counts for P(w) with counts of 4 (since I only stored counts>=5).

 Then for each X,Y I looked at, I took the top 200 scoring words,
 broke them into 10 equal-frequency bins, and built a "tagcloud"
 visualization of them.  The top 200 ignored a handful of stuff that I
 decided was noise: signature line tokens, like ----; words like
 "pstin", which seem to be poorly-tokenized dkos words; date, time and
 number words; and words like kos, dailykos, entry, diary, fold, and
 email.

===================================================================
X		  Y			  file name

dkos comment	  dkos entry		  <a href="blueComment-blueEntry.html">blueComment-blueEntry.html</a>   
===================================================================

 For a few other context's I scored as 

 log [ P(w|X)*P(W|Y) / P(w|GE) ]

 ie "non-general English" words that are "common in both context X and
 context Y"

===================================================================
X,Y			  file name               
===================================================================
dkos,redstate comments	  <a href="blue+red-comment.html">blue+red-comment.html</a>        
dkos,redstate entries	  <a href="blue+red-entry.html">blue+red-entry.html</a>          
dkos,redstate anything	  <a href="blue+red-all.html">blue+red-all.html</a>
===================================================================

 - I also wrote code to pick up subject-matter 'tags' from dailykos
 (like the delicious tagging scheme), which turned out to be pretty
 noisy (eg, "republican" and "repulican party" are both tags, as are
 "iraq" and "iraq war".)  I set up some additional contexts X = "dkos
 comments for entries tagged with something that contains the word T"
 and compared them to Y="all dkos comments"

===================================================================
T		file name		
===================================================================
elections	<a href="blueElections-blue-comment.html">blueElections-blue-comment.html</a>
iraq		<a href="blueIraq-blue-comment.html">blueIraq-blue-comment.html</a>
media		<a href="blueMedia-blue-comment.html">blueMedia-blue-comment.html</a>
===================================================================

 - Sizes of all of this, in words:

<h2>Observations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Redstate has way less comment text total than dkos, but way more
entry text.  There are also more entries in redstate than dkos (788 vs
351) so the amount of entry text may simply be more because dkos has a
bunch of high-inlink pages that are not comment-containing.

<li>Dems are way <a href="blueComment-blueEntry.html">less polite</a> in comments than in blog entries.
Republicans, <a href="redComment-redEntry.html">not so much.</a>

<li>There are apparently pretty big differences in vocabulary in
comments pertaining to different entries (e.g., <a
href="blueMedia-blue-comment.html">media</a> vs <a
href="blueIraq-blue-comment.html">Iraq</a>).  There doesn't seem to be
a major impact of the actual vocabulary used in the entries though -
eg I don't see the term "iraq" in the <a
href="blueIraq-blue-comment.html">Iraq-related comments</a>).

<li>A lot of the "vocabulary" from the comments may be user names.

<li>There seems to be a lot of argumentation in the <a href="blue+red-comment.html">comment sections</a>
(agree, aren't, doesn't, don't, etc)
